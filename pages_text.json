  "page_20": "The Dallas National Particle Accelerator Institute in Dallas, Texas. It stood in\nthe United States of North America (not the north of the United States of\nAmerica, but the united states whose domain spanned the North American\ncontinent). Currently, in its linear collider with a total length of thirty\nkilometers, an experiment to generate and evaporate a micro black hole based\non extradimensional theory was about to get underway.\nPreparations had been completed two years ago, but the institute had never\ngotten the green light due to the unknowable risks involved. Instead, what had\ngiven this experiment the push it needed was the event that had occurred in\nthe Far East a month prior.\nOn the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula, a large explosion had wiped out\nan armed city and its nearby fleet in an instant. It wouldn’t be an overstatement\nto call it a major world affair rather than a simple “incident.”\nNot because of the destruction’s scope—but because of its presumed\nmethod.\nA team of scientists working at the Department of Defense had concluded\nafter fierce debate that the explosion had been caused by the conversion of\nmass into energy. Three years ago, this was no more than a tentative\nhypothesis by a few scholars. But this time, the scientists’ outlook was\nunanimous.\nBy calculating from the estimated size of the explosion, the mass converted to\nenergy was approximately one kilogram—even if the reaction of such a huge\namount of mass had never been observed before, the concept of particle-\nantiparticle annihilation had already been precisely measured using\nexperimental devices, and they knew what kind of phenomena would occur.",
  "page_21": "However, data on this “Great Bomb” recorded by reconnaissance satellites\nhadn’t displayed characteristics that matched the annihilation data measured at\nexperimental facilities. The satellites also hadn’t detected any residual matter\nfrom nuclear fission or fusion. The only thing this could mean was that someone\nhad implemented a high-energy explosion using a method the scientists didn’t\nknow about, via either science or magic.\nTheir final conclusion caused anxiety to sweep through the USNA’s\nleadership.\nIf the explosion had been caused by magic, the USNA wouldn’t be able to\nemulate it, and that was that.\nAnd that was because, despite advances in magic systematization, it was still\na largely personal thing. But without understanding what the underlying\nmechanisms of the explosion were, their scientists couldn’t even work on\ncountermeasures. If that muzzle ever pointed at them, their only recourse\nwould be to sit back and be devastated. It would be the very definition of a\nnightmare.\nWhat was the explosion? Could they get at least a hint related to the mass-\nenergy conversion’s underlying mechanisms? Those questions were the final\npush needed to advance this micro black hole generation-vaporization\nexperiment.\nThere was a precise hypothesis in place describing the phenomena that would\noccur during mass-energy conversion during black hole vaporization. Scientists\nhad conducted experiments with micro black holes to verify that conclusion in\nthe first place. And the data observed from the Great Bomb didn’t match what\nhad been predicted.\nHawking radiation, however, was a phenomenon the scientists had far less\nobservational data on than annihilation, and the USNA scientists believed they\ncould get observational data that didn’t match theoretical predictions.\nMaybe they would observe characteristics matching those of the Great Bomb.\nThe possibility wasn’t zero.\nAt the time, the USNA’s leaders were mentally cornered enough to give a\ndangerous experiment the green light based on something so ephemeral.",

  "page_23": "There was only one month remaining in AD 2095.\nLooking back on the year, Tatsuya keenly felt that it had been a dizzying one.\nHe’d fought terrorists in April, an international crime syndicate in August, and\nforeign invaders in October. Turbulent didn’t begin to describe it.\nBut he still didn’t have the luxury of leisurely thinking back on his year. Not\nbecause of the guiding motto of “There’s still a month left, you never know\nwhat will happen until it’s over,” but because of a more pressing, realistic\nreason: “…Guh! I just don’t get it!”\n“Be quiet! Stop shouting! You’re so annoying!”\n“L-Leo, Erika, calm down…”\nIt was that detestable natural enemy of almost all calling themselves\nstudents, whether in middle school, high school, or university. An unavoidable\nroadblock. A wall they had to overcome—exams were upon them.\nThe usual suspects had gathered at Shizuku’s house—or mansion, rather.\nTatsuya, Miyuki, Erika, Leo, Mizuki, Mikihiko, Honoka, and Shizuku were all\nthere, without a single person missing, for a group study session in advance of\ntheir midterms.\nMost of those in the group were high achievers, at least on written tests. The\nonly possible exception, Leo, was still average; he didn’t need to worry about\nfailing. The practical portion was the part to really worry about, but that was\noutside the scope of this study session.\nDespite the occasional strange cries, the room in general had the air of a\npeaceful teatime—that is, until the bomb Shizuku dropped.",
  "page_24": "“Huh? Shizuku, could you say that again?” asked Honoka, flustered.\n“I’m actually going to be studying abroad in America,” repeated Shizuku, the\nsame exact words in the same exact tone.\n“You didn’t tell me!”\n“Sorry. I wasn’t allowed to say until yesterday.”\nAs Honoka paled at the news and pressed her friend, Shizuku’s head dipped\napologetically, conveying the only emotion everyone could read on her. Now\nthat Honoka understood that Shizuku had wanted to reveal it earlier but\ncouldn’t, she couldn’t say anything more.\n“You managed to get approved?” remarked Erika, but not because she\ndoubted Shizuku’s academic (or linguistic) prowess. In this age, governments\nrestricted overseas voyages unofficially but substantially to avoid the leakage of\ngenes—and thus of military resources—of high-level magicians.\nThe USNA was ostensibly an ally nation, but it was also a latent rival country\nin the Pacific region. Under normal conditions, studying abroad there would\nnever be approved.\n“Mm. For some reason I got permission. Dad says it’s because it’s an\nexchange program.”\n“Why would they be okay with it just because it’s an exchange program?”\nwondered Mizuki.\n“I dunno.”\nMizuki’s question was a reasonable one; the logic evaded even Tatsuya. He\ncould try to force it into his brain regardless, but he didn’t have nearly enough\ninformation to make it click. So he decided to abandon his jog in the mental\nhamster wheel and think about the matter at hand instead: “How long? When\ndo you leave?”\n“Right after the new year. It’ll be three months.”\n“Only three months… Don’t scare me like that!” Honoka put a hand to her\nchest in relief.\nBy Tatsuya’s logic, even three months was too long (as in, he was surprised",
  "page_25": "the government had approved it).\nBut that, too, didn’t matter.\n“Then we’ll have to have a going-away party,” he proposed to his friends.\nBecause that was the true matter at hand.\nThe midterms ended safely, bringing the date to December 24, a Saturday. It\nwas both the last day of the second school term and Christmas Eve.\nEven after weathering a third world war, the Japanese were as indifferent as\never when it came to religion. This wasn’t necessarily because they lacked\nreligious belief, but more because, in the backs of their minds, they considered\neven the absolute gods of the monotheistic religions single entities among\nmany. For that reason, they celebrated the New Year and Christmas in the same\ngeneral manner as before.\nAnd that day, the streets were decorated for Christmas.\nPerhaps it would be more accurate to say they were decorated for the\ncommercialization of Christmas, but that would be pedantically cynical. It would\nbe one thing if a person didn’t have anyone to talk to while espousing that, but\nto assume such a perverse attitude while surrounded by cute (!) girls, to the\npoint that it poisoned the group waters, would be ridiculously ill-advised. (Of\ncourse, in a girl’s case, the phrase “surrounded by cute guys” might be more\napt.) Yes… Even if one was presented with a going-away party, its date brought\npurposely to December 24, and therein given a small, fresh cream cake with the\nwords “MERRY XMAS” written in white chocolate atop it—even then, one\nmustn’t call it mismatched. In the first place, going by this shop’s style, it read\n“WEIHNACHTEN” rather than “XMAS,” but that too was perhaps, well, in good\nsport for the cultural exchange–oriented occasion.\n“Brother, does something concern you?”\nHe shook his head at his sister, her flowering beauty making it seem like she\nwas dressed up despite wearing her school uniform, and muttered, “It’s\nnothing.”\nYes. It was nothing—it had to be nothing. He mustn’t do anything that would",

This may not quite fit the bill for a going-away\nparty, but the owner gave us this cake, so for our toast, let’s go with…merry\nChristmas.”\n“Merry Christmas!”\nIn response to Tatsuya calmly leading the toast, his friends responded with\ncheery voices, and they thrust their glasses high.\nOn the entrance to the café, Einebrise, was a sign saying RESERVED FOR THE DAY.\nAcross the Pacific Ocean on the North American continent, it was still the\nnight before Christmas Eve. The date was just about to shift to the twenty-\nfourth.\nCompared to Japan, where the majority treated Christmas as just another\nevent, even after weathering a war that spanned twenty long years—or\nperhaps because they had weathered it—the Americans, including those people\nwho newly became American after the war, treated Christmas far more\nsincerely, piously, and fervently. In preparation for the morrow’s Christmas Eve,\nthey’d gone to sleep earlier than usual—or, at least, they should have.\nUnfortunately, late on the night before Christmas Eve, there were shadowy\ndealings taking place on a street in Dallas, Texas, a prominent city in the central\nsouth of the USNA.\nA figure, leaping from rooftop to rooftop.\nSeveral others, encircling the suspicious person from the air. Given their\nusage of specialized CADs for flight magic, which had only just begun to spread,\nthey must have been police or military magicians.\n“Stop at once, Lieutenant Alfred Fomalhaut! You should realize you can’t get\naway now!”\nDirectly in front of the fugitive stood a small figure wearing a mask covering\nher eyes.",
  "page_27": "Her high-pitched voice called for his surrender. Perhaps seeing something in\nher short frame, Alfred Fomalhaut stopped dead.\n“…What on earth is wrong, Freddy?” she asked in a slightly immature voice\nwith unease and distress mixed in, a definite softening of her previous\noverbearing tone—a shift one could call subtle. “Why would someone given a\nfirst-magnitude code name flee his unit?”\n“…”\nBut she didn’t receive an answer, only silence.\n“Some are saying the serial murders happening in the city were done with\nyour pyrokinesis. You’re not doing anything like that, are you?”\n“…”\n“Please, answer me, Freddy!”\nThe answer came, but not in the form of words.\nThe girl leaped back instantly—leaving the stole around her shoulders behind.\nThe fabric spread out, hiding her behind it, and without any spark, it lit and\nburned up.\nPyrokinesis—the power to generate fire.\nShe’d been wearing the stole over her dark-mauve uniform, and all those\nencircling the man were wearing capes and mantles as well, all cold-weather\ngear that was easy to remove.

And when it came to studying abroad overseas, which\nwould never normally be approved for them, maybe it was natural their\ncuriosity would triumph over their sadness.\n“So, where are you studying in America?”\n“Berkeley.”\nShizuku’s answer to Erika’s question was a single, curt location name, but that\nwasn’t because she was unhappy—it was just her personality.\n“Not Boston?”\nA sense that America’s modern magic research centered around Boston was\ndeep-rooted among Japanese magicians. Miyuki’s remark arose from that\nassumption.\n“The East Coast apparently isn’t a great place to be right now.”\nShizuku’s answer to Miyuki’s question was an unsettling one.\n“Oh, yeah. The humanists, right? I see them a lot on the news lately.”\nMikihiko kept in step with Shizuku’s answer.\n“First witch hunts, now magician hunts? They say history repeats itself, but\nthis is ridiculous,” Leo growled, his voice cold.",
  "page_29": "“It’s not a perfect repeat, is it? I’m not sure what was behind the witch hunts\nin the seventeenth century, but the recent ‘magician hunts’ seem like they’re\nrooted in neo–white supremacy.” Tatsuya smoothed it over with a mollifying\ntone. “…But, still, maybe you’re right to avoid the area.”\nAfter all, smoothing it over didn’t mean Tatsuya’s words were defending the\npractice.\n“I wasn’t aware of that,” Miyuki interjected after her brother spoke, her gaze\nseeking an explanation.\nTatsuya immediately answered her: “You can spot a pretty high percentage of\nthe same names in their active group member list. Said list isn’t exactly\ncirculating publicly, so you can’t be blamed for not knowing.”\n“That sounds a lot more criminal to me, Tatsuya… Anyway, let’s stop the\ndepressing talk.”\nAs Erika purposely made a joke and shook her head, Tatsuya and Miyuki gave\npained grins and nodded. They were aware the topic was a bit on the shady side\nfor the situation.",
  "page_31": "“Do you know who’s coming in exchange?”\nPerhaps feeling a responsibility to shift the mood, Miyuki’s change of subject\nwas a slightly abrupt one.\n“In exchange?”\n“It’s an exchange program, right?”\nEvidently, Shizuku didn’t seem to grasp the question at first, but after Miyuki\nprodded her a second time, a look of understanding crossed Shizuku’s face—\nalbeit a hard-to-read one, as usual.\n“A girl our age, apparently.”\nAmid a line of disappointed faces, Tatsuya smiled and asked, “Do you know\nanything else?”\n“Nope.” Shizuku nodded perfunctorily.\n“…Isn’t that just the way it is? You can be curious about this girl all you want,\nbut in the end, we just don’t have a man on the inside to tell us,” Mizuki sighed,\nputting the conversation to an end.\nAs one would understand already from the fact that they’d had the going-\naway party on this day, all eight of the people gathered here had no other plans\nfor Christmas Eve. It surprised Tatsuya that Shizuku, Erika, and Mikihiko didn’t\nhave plans at home, but the Kitayama, Chiba, and Yoshida families had thrown\nadult-oriented parties, leaving no room for freshmen in high school—thoughts\nand expectations of their parents aside.\nIt wasn’t to say they felt none of the youthful temptation of partying all night\nlong and deepening friendships, but unfortunately, they couldn’t be out until\nmidnight in their school uniforms.\n“We can’t stick around forever, or we’ll cause trouble for the proprietor.”\nAfter causing the proprietor to flounder at this suspiciously sinister turn of\nphrase (the speaker’s name omitted for privacy’s sake), the eight set out for\nhome.\nHonoka boarded the same self-driving car as Shizuku, likely because she’d be",

Honoka didn’t seem very close to her parents—though this was\nthe usual story for magic high school students.\nErika, Leo, Mizuki, and Mikihiko each got in their own vehicle. They couldn’t\nhelp but feel at least a little hope for the possibility of unexpected happenings,\nbut it looked like none of them were at that stage yet.\nTatsuya and Miyuki, for whom no unexpected incidents could occur anyway,\nboarded a two-seater ride and sat together until they returned home. On the\nsurface, the cabinet interiors were called private spaces, but Tatsuya would\nnever forget the old adage: The walls had ears. Whenever they spoke of\nentangled topics, they always obscured proper nouns. Miyuki knew to do that\nas well, and though she gave the impression of having something to say, it\nwasn’t until they passed through the front door of their house and calmed\ndown in the living room that she actually broached the subject.\n“I cannot shake the feeling that Shizuku’s study-abroad program is curious.”\nAfter they’d changed in their rooms and sat down next to each other on the\nsofa to enjoy coffee for two, Miyuki began to speak.\n“Curious… I agree.”\nTatsuya took the cup from his lips and wordlessly prompted her to continue.\nMiyuki hesitantly offered her doubts.\n“First, someone with as much magical talent as Shizuku being permitted to\nstudy abroad is unnatural. Until a short while ago, I would have been convinced\nhad she said she was studying abroad as the daughter of a wealthy\nbusinessman and not as a student of magic, but if that was the case, it’s strange\nthat we don’t know anything about the one coming here to study in exchange.\nCome to think of it, this study-abroad talk coming up so suddenly—I cannot\nhelp but feel something else is going on. It’s almost like…”\n“Almost like a backroom deal made to investigate us? According to our aunt,\nwe seem to be under suspicion, after all.” Tatsuya gave a subtle smile and spoke\nwith a tone implying it wasn’t their problem. “Material Burst. I figured they\nwouldn’t be able to leave that alone.”\nHearing the answer come from her brother’s mouth exactly as she had",
  "page_33": "hesitated to suggest it, Miyuki’s eyes widened, but a moment later she smiled,\nas though relieved.\n“I see… You thought as much as well, Brother?”\n“A student coming abroad to study here would be one thing, but considering\nit alongside our aunt’s warning, it would probably be too naive to chalk it up to\ncoincidence.”\nTatsuya had told Miyuki of his one-on-one conversation with Maya the same\nday—both about what they were being suspected of, as well as who exactly was\nunder suspicion.\n“The Stars, then…?”\n“Her forbidding me from contacting the major and the others is starting to\nhurt.”\nAs punishment for using a strategic spell without prior permission, Maya had\nprohibited him from contacting the Independent Magic Battalion for a time. He\nhad very little intention of meekly doing as he was told, but as long as the risk\nfar outweighed the return, he wouldn’t act against her directive of his own\naccord.\n“I suppose even if we ask Aunt Maya…she wouldn’t tell us.”\n“The study-abroad program is about to start, too. Clearly, she’s given her tacit\napproval on this.”\nThe Yotsuba family was currently in a position rivaling the Saegusa for\nleadership in the current Ten Master Clans. There was no way they’d be\nunaware of any irregular situations like a talented magic student studying\nabroad.\n“On the flip side, though, I think it means this won’t be all bad for us. Our aunt\nwouldn’t let someone of the caliber to investigate us slip past unnoticed.\nThere’s probably some sort of trouble in America now as well.

She could resist the urge to vomit now, unlike after those\nmissions early on, but that was only because her body had gotten used to her\nmental anguish.\nAnd the mental anguish had only gotten worse.\nHe was an American, a magician, and a member of the Stars, the USNA Army\nmagician unit directly under the Joint Chiefs of Staff—a comrade in three\ndifferent ways, and she had executed him personally.\nWhen they told her it was a mission granted to the unit’s commander, the\none with the code name Sirius, it hadn’t felt real.\nShe’d been too excited by the fame and honor to understand what it truly\nmeant to kill a countryman.\nAngie tossed again, blocking the light with an arm. She hadn’t even turned out\nthe lights in the room yet.\nSuddenly, the doorbell chimed.\nA pained smile came to Major Sirius’s lips. It would seem her meddlesome\nsubordinate had come to check on her again tonight.\nThe Stars consisted of twelve smaller units, with the commander unifying the\nother unit leaders, in form at least. Her subordinates were all leaders who had\nto see to the needs of their own units.

He was the Stars’ number two, leader of\nthe first unit and commander in the case of her absence, Benjamin Canopus.\nPosition within the Stars was not tied directly to military rank, making it an\nirregularity as a military organization. Still, they had yet to run into the\ntheoretically possible situation where a squad leader outranked the\ncommander. That being said, it wasn’t unusual at all for them both to have the\nsame rank.\nIndeed, of the twelve unit leaders, six of them were captains and six were\nmajors, the latter holding the same military rank as their commanders.\nEven though Major Sirius was far from unhappy with this arrangement, it still\nmade her anxious to hold the same rank as Canopus, who was far older than\nshe.\n“Refreshments, ma’am.”\nBenjamin Canopus, a man of about forty, had the typical appearance of a\nhigh-ranking officer, with a strong build but a slick air about him, unlike soldiers\nwho had worked their way up through the ranks or civilian businessmen.\n“Thank you, Ben.”\nHe placed a cup of steaming honey milk on the side table. Major Sirius\ndecided to be honestly grateful for the paternal consideration her subordinate\noffered. The hot milk with honey wasn’t in the kind of army tumbler used\nduring missions, but instead had been poured from a thermos into a stylish\ncommercial mug.\nShe gently put it to her lips. The warmth and sweet flavors seemed to soothe\nher anguish.\n“You’re very welcome.

  "page_36": "“Skillful and efficient, as always.”\n“I am still a girl, after all.”\nMajor Canopus shrugged at the girl young enough to be his daughter. In fact,\nhe did have a daughter—two years younger than she. “I would think being a girl\ndoesn’t have much to do with it… Perhaps it’s your Japanese blood.”\n“And I would think calling all Japanese people meticulous is a thing of the\npast.”\nWith her quarter-Japanese blood pointed out, this time it was Major Sirius’s\nturn to shrug.\nShe wasn’t especially unhappy with the comment. People who cared about\nrace wouldn’t go far—in the Stars, at least.\n“Well, in any case… You’ll have time to forget your mission of retribution and\nspread your wings for a while.”\n“It’s a special mission, not a vacation…”\nThe easygoing Major Canopus’s instigation met with Major Sirius’s lips turning\ndown into a pout. The expression was exactly suitable for a girl her age.\n“In fact, it’s miserable,” she continued with a sigh. “‘Dig up whether the\nsuspects are strategic magicians,’ they tell me. Maybe one of them is—but\nthen, isn’t it also likely neither of them is? Why would they assign me an\nundercover investigation when I’ve never done one before? I know there’s an\nage requirement, but there must be plenty of others who have the specific\ntraining for this.”\nMajor Sirius’s mission was to determine the identity of the one who executed\n—who cast—the Great Bomb, observed in the Far East in October and believed\nto be a strategic-class spell. Out of the fifty-one suspects the information\ndepartment had narrowed the field to, two of them were attending a school in\nTokyo. So they’d assigned the undercover investigation to Major Sirius, who\nwas in the same age range (coincidentally, the exact same age).\n“There, there,” said Major Canopus, putting both hands up in a pacifying\ngesture. “It must mean the general staff office considers them a very hard-to-",

One planet-class\nmagician from the Stars would also be with the major as her direct aide. There\nwasn’t any way she wouldn’t have known.\n“I know that, too, but…”\nTherefore, that answer could be called natural as well.\n“Why not think of it this way? Your role as commander is to shake them up\nafter making contact.”\n“Well… Maybe that’s more realistic. I’m essentially an amateur when it comes\nto espionage, after all.”\n“Which is why I believe you should take this chance to enjoy yourself and\nhave a good time. I think the suspects may open up to you more if you do.”\nMajor Sirius heaved a sigh. “Yes, maybe you’re right, Ben.” She returned her\nmug to the side table, then stood up in front of Major Canopus. “Ben, I leave\nthings in your care while I’m gone. It pains me to burden you with what should\nbe my duty, since we haven’t yet finished mopping up the rest of the fugitives…\nbut you’re the only one I can ask to stand in for me.”\n“Please, leave it to me, Commander.

Mentally, he shrugged it off, though when he thought back to several\nof his usual habits, he was forced to realize that he couldn’t necessarily blame\nher for the misunderstanding.\n“I ran into Sensei by coincidence,” she continued. “I came here today to\nchaperone you.”\n“I see. So that’s your story,” remarked Tatsuya. “A chaperone for high school\nstudents might feel a bit uncomfortable, but I suppose… But in that case, should\nyou be calling him sensei?”\nIn the back seat, Haruka scowled.\nHe was right—in this day and age, as a high school student, simply paying\none’s first shrine visit of the New Year didn’t necessitate adult supervision. If\nshe was going to make an excuse, he’d have expected it to be that she was\n“going with” them, not “chaperoning” them.\nAnd calling someone she’d run into by coincidence sensei, despite him not\nbeing in the teaching profession, carried the risk of sounding peculiar.\n“Shall we think about it on the way?”\nMiyuki’s proposition came only after Tatsuya opened the commuter’s door.\nIgnoring the lost-in-thought Haruka, he offered a hand to Miyuki, then closed\nthe door and rounded the commuter to get into the opposite seat, where the\ndriver would be. When he locked the door, the commuter pulled away toward\nthe station.\nThey were paid significant attention at the station as they transferred into a\nprivate train cabinet, and they drew even more stares after getting out of the\nfour-seater to make the five-minute walk to the meeting place.\n“Wow! Miyuki, you look so pretty!”\n…And when they arrived at the meeting place, those were the first words that\ngreeted Tatsuya and Miyuki. Mizuki, wearing a long dress and a fur cape-coat,\nlooked at Miyuki, spellbound. Her gaze was so enthusiastic Tatsuya wasn’t sure",
  "page_41": "she even saw him.\n“Happy New Year, Tatsuya. You look nice. Which is a little surprising.”\nHonoka, wearing a furisode like Miyuki, seemed to wince at first under the\npressure of her classmates’ attractiveness, but she smoothly diverted those\nthoughts upon seeing Tatsuya, who was dressed plainly, though with a more\nupright air about him than usual. She quickly returned to a good New Year’s\nsmile, seeing that.\n“Happy New Year,” he answered. “You look nice, too, Honoka.”\nHonoka did indeed look good in a furisode kimono, so Tatsuya didn’t feel like\nhe was flattering her. She smiled happily, and he returned it, only to then\nconsider his own clothes. “You say surprising—does this look a little weird for\nme?” he asked.\n“Nah, not at all!” said Leo. “You look good, Tatsuya. You have a kind of\ncommanding presence, like the leader of a crime syndicate.”\n“What am I, a yakuza?”\nTatsuya couldn’t tell if Leo was being serious or not. After all, Leo himself was\nin a jacket that looked like day-to-day clothes.\nMizuki, Honoka, and Leo were the three they met up with for their New\nYear’s shrine visit. Erika and Mikihiko were too busy helping around the house\nwith all their followers present, so they couldn’t slip out; Shizuku would be\nleaving for her study-abroad program very shortly and couldn’t avoid things\nrelated to her father’s job this time.\n“You don’t look particularly like a yakuza, but for sure, there aren’t many high\nschoolers who look that good in a haori and hakama.”\n“It isn’t so much yakuza as sergeant or constable.”\nAs Haruka and Yakumo, who came a few steps later, said, Tatsuya was\nwearing a haori jacket, hakama, and setta sandals today—a pure Japanese\nensemble. And as Honoka and Leo said, the outfit really suited him. In fact, the\noutfit felt empty without a larger waist and a truncheon attached.\n“Oh, Haruka! Happy New Year.”",
  "page_42": "“Happy New Year, Ms. Ono… Tatsuya, who might this be?”\nAfter Leo’s casual greeting came a more by-the-book one from Honoka, who\nthen glanced over Yakumo. After that, she sent the questioning look to Tatsuya.\n“Head priest of Kichijouji Temple, Kashou Yakumo. Maybe the rest of us\nwould know him better as the ninjutsu user Yakumo Kokonoe? He’s my martial\narts teacher.”\nHearing Tatsuya’s introduction, Honoka’s and Mizuki’s eyes widened. He’d\nfigured Honoka would know the name Yakumo, but Mizuki was beyond his\nexpectations.\n“I get it. That’s why we were talking about going to the Hie Shrine for this.”\nAnd when Leo demonstrated an unlikely piece of knowledge, Tatsuya was\noutright surprised. Certainly not because he’d been looking down on Leo, but…\n“What do you mean?”\n…because, as one could see from Haruka being completely clueless, it wasn’t\na fact most normal people knew.\n“Hm? Kashou—that means he’s a Tendai Buddhist monk, right? Aren’t praying\nto Sannou and Taimitsu rituals basically joined at the hip within the Tendai\nsect?” explained Leo, looking confused as to why she had asked.\nHowever, the question marks above Haruka’s head only increased with this\nnew information.\n“You’re quite knowledgeable for someone so young. Your name is Leonhard\nSaijou, right?” Leaving behind the confusion, Yakumo addressed Leo in a jovial\ntone.\n“Huh? You know who I am?” Leo blurted.\n“Yes. I had a chance to watch recordings of the Nine School Competition,”\nanswered Yakumo. His response was also straightforward, without any twists,\nbut when Leo heard it, he reflexively scowled. He’d probably remembered his\nanachronistic and out-of-place mantle getup. Apparently it was a memory he’d\nhave liked to forget.\nWith preliminary introductions finished, the seven of them—the five",
  "page_43": "classmates, the man with the shaven head (though he didn’t wear the kesa robe\nof a Buddhist priest, but instead a normal men’s kimono), and the young\nwoman—walked in a pack toward the main shrine. Fortunately for Haruka,\nnobody asked her why she was going with them.\nRoadside stands lined either side of the shrine approach, a sight unchanged\nfor a century. But even this was a scene that had vanished in most places with\nthe worsening of the global food crisis. It was likely a deeply emotional sight for\nthose old enough to remember it, but Tatsuya and the others didn’t have any\nsuch sentiment for the past.\nWithout any particular detours, they walked up the long staircase, passed\nthrough the shrine gates, and entered the inner yard in front of the outer\nshrine. There, Tatsuya suddenly felt eyes on him.\nNot a rude, scrutinizing stare, but the glancing kind, of someone stealing looks\nat him.\n“Any idea, Shiba?”\n“No, ma’am.”\n“Heh. Maybe Tatsuya’s outfit is an unusual sight for foreigners.”\nThey quite skillfully played it casual, but there was no fooling Haruka and\nYakumo’s eyes. Even Tatsuya had noticed it without using Elemental Sight, so\nHaruka aside, it was only natural that his master would as well.\nAs Yakumo said, the “foreigner” had the stereotypical blonde hair and green\neyes—and she was a young girl. In these times, though, that didn’t necessarily\nmean she was a citizen of another country. Plus, her features gave off a\nJapanese impression, somehow.\nShe looked about Tatsuya’s age. Considering the ethnic differences, it would\nbe easy to mistake her for younger than she was, but Tatsuya decided that she\nwasn’t that much younger than they were at all.\n“What might you be looking at, Brother?”\nHe hadn’t had his eyes on the girl for more than a second, but that was\nenough for Miyuki to notice. When she followed where his gaze was, her eyes",
  "page_44": "rose in surprise.\n“…Well, she is a pretty girl,” said his sister flatly, her inner thoughts readily\napparent.\nTo be certain, the girl was pretty enough that Miyuki calling her such wasn’t\nsarcasm. Vividly colored hair and eyes. In a sense, her beauty was the direct\nopposite of Miyuki’s. But that certainly hadn’t been why Tatsuya was looking at\nher.\nHe glanced at Yakumo for help—and when he saw the childish smirk on the\nman’s lips, he realized he’d have to do something about this himself.\nHe peered directly into his sister’s eyes, and in a cool, uninterested tone of\nvoice, he responded, “Not as pretty as you, though.”\n“…Please, don’t think you can use that trick to fool me every time.”\nThe words were a fierce counterattack on their own, but her giddy voice,\nvermilion cheeks, and wandering eyes left little need for fear.\n“I’m not trying to fool you. That’s what I honestly think, and I wasn’t looking\nat her for that reason anyway.”\n“Brother, I swear!” Miyuki quickly went to turn her face away but then\nrealized something that wouldn’t let her turn a blind eye to what he’d said. “…Is\nthere something suspicious about her?”\n“Suspicious? Well, her clothing, for starters…” answered Tatsuya in a voice\nlike he was about to crack a pained grin.\nMiyuki stole a second glance at the blonde-haired, green-eyed girl, and was\nvery nearly convinced of the whole matter.\nA light-beige half coat and a skirt with a frilled hem. Patterned tights and long\nboots. Simply hearing those things wouldn’t be strange. But her half coat was\nthe same length as her skirt, which had a four-inch inseam.

It wasn’t strange that\neven Tatsuya, a guy, would think it was strange.\nBut Miyuki knew her brother wasn’t the type to seriously worry about such\nsurface things.\n“That isn’t all, is it?”\nThis time, she directed a strong-willed gaze at the girl, unlike before.\nPerhaps sensing it, though her face betrayed nothing, the girl began to walk.\nToward Tatsuya’s group.\nWithout saying anything, she passed by them, then walked up the long\nstaircase.\nBut her route made Tatsuya certain that she’d come near just to cast a glance\nat them.\nWhile the mission given to Major Angelina Sirius was an undercover\ninvestigation, it also had a strong diversionary aspect to it. In accordance with\nthat, their first contact seemed to have gone well—she’d gotten a look at her\ntargets, and they at her. She’d been worried they wouldn’t notice her, since\nshe’d concealed her presence, but her subordinate had been right earlier—\nthere was no need to fear. Still, being spotted so easily wasn’t satisfying in and\nof itself, she thought as she opened the door to the apartment that would be\nher base of living operations for this mission.\n“Welcome back.”\nContrary to Major Sirius’s prediction that her roommate wouldn’t be back yet,\na voice came from the room to welcome her.\n“Silvie, you’re back?”\nWhen her older roommate came to the door to greet her, the major called\nher by her nickname.\nThis young woman’s name was Silvia Mercury First. Everything past the Silvia\nwas a code name, marking her as the highest among the Mercury-rank planet-",
  "page_46": "class magicians within the Stars. Her actual military rank was warrant officer,\nthough, and her age twenty-five. As could be understood from her being given\nthe First code name despite her young age, she was a woman whose talents\nwere highly rated. Silvia hadn’t originally wanted to be a soldier—she’d majored\nin journalism. Now, though, her information analysis skills made her valuable\nenough to be selected as Major Sirius’s aide.\n“Silvie?”\nSupposedly talented, Major Sirius’s roommate didn’t answer her words,\ninstead staring intently at her. The major, dubious, said her name a second\ntime, and Silvia finally spoke, her gaze steady.\n“Lina… What are you wearing?”\nLina was Major Angelina Sirius’s nickname when she was off the clock, and\nshe had ordered that she be called that rather than Commander or Major\nduring the undercover mission. Silvia had always been a free-spirited woman,\nso regardless of the rank and position difference between them, she quickly got\nused to using it—and speaking frankly.\nThough she hadn’t been outright rude, it wasn’t something one would usually\nsay to a superior officer. But “Lina” didn’t seem to mind it whatsoever.\n“Oh, this? I did some research on Japan’s fashion idols from the last century\nso I wouldn’t stand out more than I had to. It was hard work, too. How do I\nlook?”\n“…Before I answer that, I’d like to ask something.”",
  "page_48": "“Yes, what is it?”\nSilvia was making a face like she was nursing a headache and about to\nmassage her temples, but Lina didn’t seem to notice. “Isn’t it hard to walk in\nthose boots?” she asked.\nLina nodded, as if heartily agreeing with her. “It is! I nearly tripped a few\ntimes. I don’t know how Japanese girls don’t twist their ankles walking in\nthese.”\n“Did you see any other girls wearing the same kind of boots?”\nIt should have only needed one question, but it took two. Still, Lina didn’t\nseem very bothered. “Hmm? Now that I think of it, I didn’t.”\nSilvia’s expression changed; now it looked like she both had a headache and\nwanted to sigh. “Lina, I’ll be frank. Those boots are way out of fashion.”\n“Huh?!”\nLina’s eyes went wide, and the sight made Silvia’s irritation explode. “Don’t\nhuh me! It’s not just the boots! Your tights and that hat are out of fashion, too.\nOne hundred years is too far back! And your coordination is incredibly\nincoherent. This isn’t the fashion sense a young woman would have. I bet you\nstood out like a sore thumb in that.”\nThe uncomfortable face her scolding met with told Silvia that her roommate\nknew what she was talking about. Truthfully, Lina had noticed eyes on her\nwherever she went. She’d shrugged them off, though, figuring a foreigner was a\nrare sight.\n“I know you were supposed to draw the targets’ attention…but how are you\ngoing to handle drawing the attention of people who have nothing to do with\nus?”\nFinally unable to hold it in any longer, Silvia heaved a sigh.\n“Commander.”\nThe word was polite; the tone was cold. Lina thought she felt a cold sweat\nbreak out along her spine.",

I do not wish to be rude, but this\nMercury will explain Japan’s latest fashion trends in a detailed and easy-to-\nunderstand way,” announced Silvia, hands on her hips.\nLina might have far eclipsed Silvia in combat power, but these were words she\njust couldn’t fight.\nAfter a short but eventful Winter Break, the third school quarter began.\nThe “eventful” things included, for one, the unexpectedly tearful parting\nwhen seeing Shizuku off at the airport (main roles: Honoka, Shizuku; supporting\nroles: Miyuki, Mizuki, with Tatsuya at a loss)—but Tatsuya had faith that the\nexperience would turn into a good memory one day. He had to, or it would\nhave been too harrowing.\nThe transfer student would be replacing Shizuku in Class A starting today, but\nit didn’t have anything to do with Tatsuya. He wasn’t completely unrelated as\nlong as she was in the same class as Miyuki, but he had no desire to involve\nhimself with her.\nSpeaking of classes, they were on a full-time curriculum right from the first\nday of the new quarter. At the end of first period, rumors about the transfer\nstudent in Class A were already making their way around, but he wasn’t going\nto be assertive and put up an antenna for it; the gossip went in one ear and out\nthe other.\nHis aloof stance, however, still placed him in the minority, and during their\nbreak after second period, he too was caught up in the vortex of rumors by a\ncertain curious friend.\n“I hear she’s gorgeous,” said Erika, coming up to him immediately, looking\nexcited—or maybe feigning excitement—at which point he decided he could no\nlonger leave things unaddressed. “Beautiful blonde hair, too. Even the\nupperclassmen are showing up to see her…”\n“You going sightseeing, too, Erika?” he asked; for now, despite her fevered\ndescriptions, it was all hearsay.\n“No, there’s way too many people for me to get in.”",
  "page_50": "“Huh,” interjected Leo. “I guess you do know how to restrain yourself—”\nNo sooner had he retorted with this than his hands flew over his head in\ndefense. A moment later, there was a frog-like out-of-tune sound, and he bent\nforward in pain, clutching his throat—which had been left unprotected.\nIf he knows she’ll do it, why does he bother saying that stuff?\nAs Tatsuya stared unsympathetically down at Leo, who was writhing after\nbeing caught in the throat by a rolled-up notebook, the perpetrator—Erika—\ncontinued to talk as though nothing had happened. “Well, I’m a girl, right? I\ndon’t care how beautiful she is—it’s not worth having to jostle my way through\na squeezing crowd just to see her.”\nTatsuya was of the exact same opinion when it came to having no intention of\nactually going to see her, but as a man, in terms of opinions that linked his\ncuriosity fully to his sexuality, he felt the need to object.\n“Nobody expects transfer students at a magic high school, after all. It’s only\nnatural to be curious about one. Hasn’t happened for at least ten years, right?”\n“I don’t know about before, but we’re apparently not the only one who got an\nexchange student,” interjected Mikihiko, just having arrived from the geometry\nprep room. “I hear Second, Third, and Fourth High have all accepted a short-\nterm exchange student. A few apparently came to the university, too, under the\npretense of joint research. One of our followers was talking about it.”\n“Oh, I heard about the university, too,” said Erika. “Rumor is that when they\nfound out how incredible flight magic is for military applications after the\nYokohama incident, they were falling over themselves to come here and scope\nit out.”\nThough old magic and modern magic were different fields, the Yoshida and\nChiba had many followers who used each, so the amount of information that\ncame to them personally was on a different level than what people outside of\nthe families could glean. Based on what Tatsuya’s friends had said, the USNA\nhad put a good deal more people into this than the families had expected. In\nOctober, the talk had been of the Stars acting by themselves; now, it looked like\nthe situation had gotten quite a bit worse since then.",
  "page_51": "“Then you think the transfer student in Class A is a spy, too?” asked Leo,\noutspoken as ever, having recovered from his agonies.\n“Look, you…”\nErika wasn’t the only one to give a sour face—Mizuki and Mikihiko did as well.\n“Leo, you’re not supposed to say those things out loud…” scolded Mizuki.\n“We have to support her as classmates, you know…” added Mikihiko.\nEven attacked by their doubles lineup, Leo managed an argument. “You say\nclassmates, but she’s in Class A, isn’t she? We’ll barely see her.”\n“Miyuki’s in Class A, stupid,” said Erika, cleaving his objection in two. “The\nstudent council vice president and the first transfer student in who knows how\nmany years. It might only be until she gets used to the school, but Miyuki will\nhave to look out for her. If she and Miyuki are involved with each other, than\nwe’ll have to be, too.”\nTatsuya, who didn’t want to proactively involve himself with the new girl,\nsighed to himself, thinking that Erika, unfortunately, was right.\nThat involvement would come earlier than he thought. Actually, it was more\nlike it was the earliest possibility out of the ones he’d predicted—a merciless\nactualization.\nHis group of friends met for lunch in the cafeteria like always. Miyuki and\nHonoka came, as well as one other—a blonde-haired, green-eyed girl. Seeing\nher wasn’t exactly shocking, but it did cause Tatsuya a momentary bout of\nSeriously?\nHe’d heard of her hair and eye color and more than his fill of gossip about\nhow pretty she was. Anyway, if she was just a pretty girl, Tatsuya had his\nresistance built up from Miyuki. No, the surprise he felt this time around wasn’t\nbecause of the happenstance or her beauty; it was because the new girl was the\nsame one they’d met—or rather, chanced to see—at Hie Shrine.\n“Would you mind very much if I sat with you?”\nFrom her mouth flowed fluent Japanese. She had something of an accent to\nher emphases, but one couldn’t blame her. She was studying abroad in Japan,",
  "page_52": "after all—though it was possible it was all pretense, meant to craft a believable\ninfiltration.\n“Sure, go ahead.”\nHer eyes were directed at Tatsuya. He didn’t feel much need to square off\nagainst her, so he spoke candidly.\n“Lina, let’s get our plates first.”\n“Plates? …Oh, for the food. All right.”\nTatsuya and the others had already gotten their meals. Prompted by Miyuki,\nthe three of them headed for the serving counter. The buzz where they went\nsounded louder to him than normal. More students let them past, too, in awe.\n“She really is a knockout next to the two of them, huh?”\nErika, despite also being attractive, wasn’t the type to put pressure on those\nwho saw her, and even she had to breathe a word at the sight.\n“She seems to be pretty friendly with them…” said Mizuki, probably referring\nto how they’d just met today.\n“Hey, Tatsuya…” said Leo. “I feel like I’ve seen her somewhere before.”\n“Whoa. Now that’s an ancient pickup line.” Erika immediately snapped back a\nretort, but she quickly realized that Leo wasn’t that enamored by the girl,\nbecause, truthfully, she had wanted to say it, too.\n“…You know, you’re right.” Mizuki nodded in agreement.\n“Wait, you, too, Shibata? She…can’t be a celebrity or a model, could she?”\nwondered Leo.\nOf course, Tatsuya knew the truth lay elsewhere. In fact, he was surprised\nthey didn’t very clearly remember someone dressed up so conspicuously. As he\nwondered whether to clear up his friends’ questions here and now, the three\nothers came back together.\nHe felt many sets of eyes gather on them. Gazes pretending to be casual, but\nunable to hide a strong interest, from all over the room. People were always\nlooking at Miyuki, but there were clearly more people stealing glances their way",
  "page_53": "now.\n“I’m sorry for the wait, Brother.” Acting like it didn’t bother her at all, Miyuki\nsat down naturally next to Tatsuya.\n“I’ll introduce you, Tatsuya,” said Honoka, setting her tray down across from\nhim like it was totally normal, turning to the girl who sat next to her. “Her name\nis Angelina Kudou Shields. As I’m sure you’ve heard, she’s the exchange student\nwho started in Class A today.”\nAfter hearing Honoka’s introduction, Tatsuya—and the other three as well—\ngave troubled expressions.\n“Honoka, would you introduce me to everyone else, and not just this\nperson?”\nBut it was the exchange student in question who spoke for their concerns.\n“Oh, ah, I-I’m sorry!”\n“…Well, that’s Honoka for you.”\n“That it is.”\nErika and Mizuki both spoke truly, not trying to make fun of her. Honoka went\nred in the face and clammed up.\n“Allow me. This is Angelina Kudou Shields. She’s from America.”\nAfter Miyuki’s second introduction, the transfer student gave a bow in her\nseat, her blonde hair fluttering. “Please, call me Lina,” she said, narrowing her\neyes into a beautiful smile.\nHer deep-blue eyes weren’t the color of water, or of ice, but the blue of the\nazure sky. Her wavy blonde hair, bound by ribbons to either side of her head,\nwould probably reach to the small of her back when undone. It might have even\nbeen longer than Miyuki’s. Her mature features for a freshman in high school\nand her coquettish hairstyle seemed somewhat unbalanced, but it served to\nsoften the sharp impression her beauty made, giving her an air of amiability.\nMore eyes were on them than usual, and she was clearly the cause. After\nhearing her name again from Miyuki, even as they were taken by her gorgeous\nsmile (two male students in particular), mild surprise was on their faces;",
  "page_54": "Tatsuya preempted them and returned the introduction. “I am Tatsuya Shiba,\nfrom Class E. As I’m sure it’s confusing to have two Shibas at the table, you may\nsimply call me Tatsuya.”\n“Thanks. You can call me Lina, too. And I’d be grateful if we didn’t need to\nspeak formally with one another.”\n“All right, then.”\n“Pleased to meet you, Tatsuya.”\nLina reached a hand across the table—perhaps it was customary—so Tatsuya\ngently took it from underneath, as though holding it up reverently.\nIt wasn’t a handshake; the act was like that of someone asking a noblewoman\nfor a kiss. Was it beyond her expectations?\n“Tatsuya, are you by chance Miyuki’s older brother?” asked Lina, confusion\nrising in her sky-blue eyes but her expression casual.\nAs he reflected on her lack of a poker face, Tatsuya nodded with a smile,\ncareful not to chuckle. He purposely didn’t point out that Miyuki had called him\nas much a few moments ago.\n“I’m Erika Chiba. You can call me Erika, Lina.” Being gregarious in times like\nthis was doubtless one of Erika’s strong points.\n“I’m Mizuki Shibata. Please, call me Mizuki.”\n“And I’m Leonhard Saijou. Leo’s just fine. I’m a little rude when I talk\nsometimes, but don’t take it personally.”\n“I’m Mikihiko Yoshida. You can just call me Mikihiko, too.”\nTaking encouragement from Erika, Mizuki, Leo, and Mikihiko introduced\nthemselves in turn.\n“Erika, Mizuki, Leo, and Mikihiko. Nice to meet you.”\nLina memorized all their names without having to ask again. It was an\nelementary skill, but also the first step in earning goodwill from others, and she\nhad it down pat.\nStill, when she said Mikihiko’s name, it sounded like two names—Miki Hiko.",
  "page_55": "His very Japanese name must have been difficult for her American tongue.\n“It’s hard to say, isn’t it? You don’t have to call him Mikihiko—you can just use\nMiki.”\nIf the person himself had said it, that would have been an impressive display\nof consideration, but when another person said it—Erika, in particular—it\nseemed like more than just friendliness. At least, Mikihiko seemed to feel that\nway and tried to object to Erika’s words (or rather, suggestion).\n“Oh, is that so? I’ll do that then. Is Miki all right with you?”\nBut right before he could, Lina asked that with a face that looked relieved—\nforcing him to accept the proposal.\nLina had chosen the soba noodles from the cafeteria menu, and as she\nwielded her chopsticks with an assured manner, she answered all the questions\nthat occasionally came her way without so much as a sour face. It probably\nhelped that none of the group was the type to ask anything ill-mannered. As\neveryone was about finished eating, Lina seemed to have opened up quite a bit.\nThat was when Tatsuya, representing the other Class E members harboring the\nsame question, asked it: “By the way, Lina, would you happen to be a blood\nrelation of His Excellency Kudou?”\nOld Sage was a moniker only used by Japan’s magicians. And Tatsuya\npersonally didn’t like the term. Instead, he asked the question with the term His\nExcellency, used publicly out of respect for the retired general.\n“I seem to recall His Excellency’s younger brother visiting America and\nstarting a family there.”\nThat was in an age when international marriages between magicians were\nencouraged. At the time, Retsu Kudou was already seen as the world’s\nstrongest—and trickiest—magician. His younger brother had moved to America\nand begun a family there with an American magician, which was quite a topic of\nconversation for at least Japan’s magicians.\n“Oh, I’m surprised you knew that, Tatsuya. It was quite a long time ago.”\nTatsuya’s speculation turned out to be right. Also, from that, he understood\nthat Retsu Kudou’s brother’s bones being interred in American soil as those of",

Retsu Kudou had long held a\nleadership position among Japan’s magicians, and even now, ones from the\nWest still called him shogun. She may have been a quarter Japanese, and she\nmay have been fluent in the language, but she was still an American magician\nthrough and through.\n“I think the connection was how the topic of a foreign exchange program was\nbrought to me.”\n“Oh, then you didn’t request for it yourself, Lina?” piped in Erika casually.\nThe slight disturbance Lina showed at that was also likely not Tatsuya just\nseeing things.",

No external wounds, also the same as always.”\nAfter hearing Lieutenant Inagaki’s report, Chief Toshikazu Chiba spread his\narms and looked up, as though entreating the heavens. “And all the blood is\ngone, too, right? …The fifth freak death this month. It’s getting real hard to\nkeep the media off this.”\nWithout speaking of the victim or the perpetrator, Chief Toshikazu Chiba\nbreathed a troubled sigh. And though his expression said he found it all a huge\npain, in his eyes there glinted the sharp light of a hunter.\nAngelina Sirius’s debut at First High was sensational.\nHer looks, for one, became such an entity that by the end of her first day, not\na student in school didn’t know about them.\nUntil now, the seat of most beautiful girl had belonged to Miyuki. This had\nbeen a unanimous viewpoint, including from upperclassmen and female\nstudents.\nBut with Lina in the picture now, their “queen” had become a binary star.\nTheir frequent opportunities to do things together only added to the\nimpression.\nGolden hair that glittered in the sunlight. Eyes that shone bluer than\nsapphires.\nBlack hair that was deeper than the night sky. Clear eyes that were darker\nthan a black pearl.\nBoth equally beautiful, yet possessing contrasting types of beauty: When the\ntwo young women stood together, it seemed only to heighten their individual\nradiances.\nTheir looks alone were enough to be the subject of conversation, but…\n“Here I come, Miyuki.”",
  "page_59": "“I’m ready anytime. You may do the countdown.”\nNow, they stood facing each other, separated by three yards.\nBetween them, a one-inch metal ball sat atop a slender pole.\nSeveral similar fixtures were set up in the practice room, but all their\nclassmates stopped what they were doing to watch them.\nNo, not only their classmates.\nThe viewing seats up on a mezzanine making a circuit around the room were\npacked with seniors who were no longer required to attend school now that all\ntheir mandatory classes were completed.\nMayumi and Mari were among them.\n“…You think her magic power really rivals Shiba’s?”\n“In a way, she came to Japan representing America, so I don’t think it’s\nimpossible. But it’s hard to believe it so suddenly—magic ability on par with\nMiyuki’s in someone of the same age?”\n“Agreed. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I won’t believe it\nuntil I see it.”\n“Well, that is why we came to take a look, after all.”\nThis practice would be a simple and highly gamelike exercise, where the two\ngirls would use their CADs at the same time, each aiming to be the first to\ncontrol the metal ball in the middle. Its simplicity would highlight pure power\ndifferential and nothing more.\nThe students had begun this exercise last month, and none of Miyuki’s\nclassmates could come anywhere close to beating her. There was such a\ndifference in their magic power that even the instructors were forced to admit\nthe exercise would be pointless for both her and her opponents.\nAfter hearing about it, student council members old and new (plus the\ndisciplinary committee chairwoman) took turns challenging her; that none of\nthem could hold a candle to her was now a badly kept secret at First High.\nCrushed without difficulty, their pride as upperclassmen in pieces (though",
  "page_60": "Miyuki was very humble about her victories), Mayumi and Mari joining the\nothers in spectating was only natural.\n“Three, two, one…” counted down Lina in English.\nThe CAD they would use was a panel interface, fixed in place. When Lina said\n“one,” they both held a hand over the panel.\n“Go!”\nThe last signal was given by both voices.\nMiyuki’s fingers touched the panel, and Lina’s palm slammed it.\nStatic and dynamic—their start-up methods reflected their colors exactly.\nBut the contrast was merely physical.\nA flash of psionic light burst over the metal target.\nBecause the light was invisible to the naked eye, shutting your eyelids would\nbe ineffective. Viewers less experienced with external magical influence–\nrestraining techniques massaged their temples and shook their heads to clear\nthem.\nThe glow vanished in an instant. The metal ball rolled toward Lina.\n“Agh, I lost again!”\n“Hee-hee. That’s two wins in a row, Lina.”\nLina making a grand show of frustration, and Miyuki giving a somewhat\nrelieved smile: As one could see from their attitudes, the unofficial match had\nended in Miyuki’s victory. However, from the tone in which the “two in a row”\ncomment had been spoken, you didn’t get the impression that it was an\noverwhelming defeat. After all…\n“…They were exactly equal,” breathed Mayumi.\n“In fact, wasn’t the transfer student slightly faster triggering the spell?”\n“Yes. But Miyuki’s influence was higher, so she took control before the spell\nwas complete. You can prioritize speed, or prioritize power… This isn’t so much\na victory of pure force as a victory won through tactics.”",
  "page_61": "From both Mayumi and Mari’s point of view, their magic power—at least,\ntheir pure magic power for basic, single-type spells—was equal.\nAfter that, within their allotted time, they did the exercise four more times,\nthe score for which was two to two, making today’s winner Miyuki by two wins.\nThat afternoon, it was business as usual in the school cafeteria.\nLina was sitting with them again today, though she hadn’t done so every day.\nShe’d had several invitations from here and there during the week after she\ntransferred in, and she ate with different people each day.\nBroadening her cultural exchange with others could be called the model\nattitude for a transfer student. This was actually the first time she was eating\nwith Tatsuya’s group again since her first day.\n“You’re very popular, Lina.”\n“Thanks. I’m glad everyone here is so kind.”\nErika’s compliment had nothing hidden beneath the surface, and instead of\npointlessly getting embarrassed or acting modest, Lina gave an indifferent\nresponse. The attitude was both personal and a product of national character,\nand it came off as new and fresh for Tatsuya’s group (minus Erika).\n“You were more amazing than we thought, Lina. I mean, they chose you to\nstudy abroad and everything, so I figured you were the real deal, but I never\nthought you’d be able to compete with Miyuki on even terms.”\n“I’m actually surprised myself.”\nAt Mikihiko’s compliment, Lina’s eyes widened in a slight overreaction as she\nexpressed her surprise. As an aside, Mikihiko seemed to find Lina easier to talk\nto than Miyuki, and though he still spoke stiffly to the latter, he’d started to\nloosen up with the former.\n“I don’t mean to brag, but I was undefeated at the high school level in the\nStates. But I just couldn’t seem to win out over Miyuki. Even with Honoka, I\nwouldn’t lose in overall ability, but I would when it comes to precise control.\nJapan really is the great land of magic.”\n“Lina, that was just a training session, not a competition. I don’t think you",
  "page_62": "should care so much about winning or losing.”\n“But competition is important. It might be practice, but they purposely put\nsomething so much like a game into the curriculum. I think fussing over winning\nand losing will help us get better.”\nAt Miyuki’s gentle admonishment, Lina made a frontal objection, unafraid of\nconflict.\nThat must have been her way of doing things. This part of her, too, felt\nsomewhat fresh.\n“It’s important to have a sense of competition while you’re in the heat of\nthings. But there’s no reason to take it out of the practice room, is there?\nExercises are only exercises—they’re not like practical tests, which are\nconnected to your grades.”\nSo Tatsuya, too, decided to offer his own unreserved opinion.\n“…Yes, maybe you’re right, Tatsuya. Maybe I was getting a little too into it.”\n“It’s not a bad thing. Miyuki will have more motivation now that she has a\nnew rival. On that point, I’m grateful to have you here, Lina.”\nLina nodded without comment at first but then returned a blank stare.\n“There it is—Tatsuya’s sister complex returns,” said Erika from next to her,\ngiving an exaggerated sigh.\n“O-oh, I see… Tatsuya and Miyuki do seem close.”\nTo Tatsuya, beneath the innocuous comment, the temperature of Lina’s gaze\nfelt like it had rapidly decreased.\n“By the way, Lina, and this isn’t important or anything, but…” He got the\nfeeling the conversation was headed in a bad direction, so he tried to change\nthe topic.",
  "page_64": "“What is it?” She turned an icy gaze on him. Still, it didn’t seem like she was\ntruly scorning him; he could spot a bit of acting. She was probably going along\nwith Erika’s joke.\nHe had no guarantee that wasn’t just an optimistic outlook, but Tatsuya\nwasn’t petty enough to grimace and stop talking at something like this.\n“I thought the nickname for Angelina was Angie. Did I remember wrong?”\nThe question shouldn’t have bothered her.\nAt the very least, Erika, Mizuki, and Honoka, who were sitting with them,\nthought as much.\nBut for just a moment, an unmistakable consternation crossed her face.\n“No, you’re not. But it’s not unusual to shorten it to Lina, either. In\nelementary school, there was a girl in the same class named Angela, and we\ncalled her Angie, so…”\n“So you came to be called Lina instead of Angie?” Tatsuya nodded, appearing\nconvinced.\n…Without letting on that he’d noticed her panic.\nThere were no dormitories at First High.\nOut of necessity for the magic high schools, of which there were only nine in\nthe country, some students enrolled from far away.\nThinking about it that way, it wouldn’t seem strange to have dormitories, but\nin this day and age, aside from special schools with all-dorm systems placing\nheavy emphasis on the dorms as a learning environment, you never saw any\nsuch facilities. In an age where HARs had become normal household items and\ngroceries could be bought online and delivered to your doorstep, students had\nno trouble whatsoever living on their own, so there was no demand for\ndormitories.\nThus, most students who couldn’t commute from home rented a place near\nschool. It wasn’t unnatural for Lina, a transfer student, to rent an apartment.\nHer room was two stations from the school by train—right nearby, given",
  "page_65": "transportation in the modern era. She was renting not a single-person one-\nroom apartment for students, but one big enough for a small family, because\nshe wasn’t living on her own.\n“Welcome back, Lina.”\n“You’re home early, Silvie.”\nWhen she opened the apartment’s front door, her aide for this mission,\nWarrant Officer Silvia, came out as though she’d been waiting for her.\n“It’s already night, you know.”\nLina, who had taken several detours, gave a small, pained grin at the retort.\nWhile she was still in her uniform, they moved to the dining room. And there…\n“I didn’t know you were coming today, Mia.”\n…a young woman with a tense expression greeted Lina. She was standing in\nfront of the table, probably because she’d just been talking to Silvia.\n“Yes, Major. I hope I’m not intruding, ma’am.”\nThe woman called Mia answered in a nervous voice. Lina gave a troubled\nsmile, then sat down at the table.\n“Please, sit, Mia. Silvie, would you mind making tea?”\nNormally, Silvia would have thought nothing of their rank difference and\nresponded, “You’re a girl, so you should at least make your own tea.” But she\ncould also read the situation.\n“Is milk tea fine? Mia, would you like some more?”\n“Ah, yes, ma’am. Thank you,” answered Mia in a reserved manner, although\nher tension had loosened quite a bit.\nHer name was Mikaela Hongou, nicknamed Mia. Like Lina, she was a Japanese\nAmerican, but unlike with Lina, you couldn’t tell her apart from other Japanese\npeople. At most, her skin was a little dark, but even that wasn’t particularly\nunusual in Japan.\nShe was one of the spies they’d sent into Japan ahead of Lina and Silvia. Still,\nspying wasn’t her main profession; her main job was as a Department of",
  "page_66": "Defense magic scientist who researched emission-type magic, a girl of talent\nwho had even taken part in the black hole experiment in November in Dallas.\nSince the Dallas experiment hadn’t yielded many results, she’d requested this\nmission to search for a method of nonannihilation mass-energy conversion.\nAs was the case with many magic scientists, she was a magician herself.\nUnlike the fake students who had arrived in Japan under the pretense of\ncollaborative research starting this month, she had infiltrated the Magic\nUniversity as Mia Hongou, a sales engineer from Maximillian Devices’ Japan\nbranch, at the beginning of last month. Incidentally, her room was the one next\nto the one Lina was renting. Neither combat nor intelligence personnel, she was\nstrictly part of the support staff, but also one of the “main team,” working on\ntheir original goal—espionage activity—behind the scenes. She was supporting\nthe members who had, in a way, waltzed right up to the front door this month.\n“Have you found something out?”\nLina asked Silvie, who had finished arranging the teacups on the table and sat\ndown.\n“I’m going back over official databases, but at this time, I haven’t found any\nnew information.”\n“I see. I doubted you would get results that quickly.” Next, Lina looked over to\nMikaela. “What about you, Mia?”\n“It’s the same for me, ma’am… I’m sorry.”\nAfter seeming to have relaxed a bit, Mikaela tensed up again.\nWith her getting so nervous, Lina felt like she was bullying the poor girl, so she\nbacked off. But when Lina had first come to Japan at the end of the year, the\nMikaela she’d met had been even shakier and tenser than now. Despite the\ndifference between a scientist and a warrior, Lina was the Sirius, the top of the\nUSNA’s magicians—and in her middle teens. Telling Mia not to be nervous\nwouldn’t work. Lina and Mia could have slightly friendlier conversation now\nthat two weeks had passed since Lina’s arrival, but only when they stuck to\ntopics regarding daily life. Lina persuaded herself that was enough, since when\nit came to discussing their mission, Silvia’s frank attitude wasn’t the best thing,\neither.",
  "page_68": "“What about you, Lina?” Silvia asked. “Have you gotten a little friendlier with\nthe targets?”\nLina’s face clouded over. “I think I’ve gotten a little closer with them, but…”\nShe sighed, then let out a weak smile. “Still nothing vital. In fact, I think they’ll\nrealize who I am before I uncover anything.”\n“…Did something happen?”\n“Tatsuya asked me why my nickname wasn’t Angie instead of Lina. It scared\nme for a second!”\n“Was it a coincidence?”\n“I don’t know. I have no clue. I’m really not cut out for this, am I…?”\nLina heaved another sigh as Silvia poured more milk tea into her cup. Silvia\nand Mikaela looked at her worriedly. When she noticed that, Lina energized\nherself. “…It’s fine. They’re just high school kids. There’s no way they seriously\nthink that I’m Sirius. Even if they had suspicions, I’d never let them catch on.”\nA valiant comment at first, but it was clearly a bluff. To begin with, Lina was\nthe one who was supposed to be catching on to them. That she felt the need to\ndeclare that she wouldn’t let them get the best of her was fairly telling. Silvia\nrealized it, too, but didn’t say anything, maybe deciding it was better than Lina\ngetting depressed over it.\nHowever, she pointedly failed to mention that her targets weren’t just any\nhigh school kids.\nHe handed a gown to his sister as she rose from the examination bed, fitted\nwith only a psiometer (a psionic wave measurement device) and her\nundergarments. Tatsuya’s android-like poker face from during the examination\ndissolved into a slightly anxious look, but it was still enough for Miyuki’s eyes to\ncatch it.\n“…Is something not to your satisfaction? Brother, please, do not hesitate to\ntell me. I would do anything you tell me to do.”\nStill, that was an overreaction—or, rather, simply an extreme reaction overall.",
  "page_69": "Feeling such, Tatsuya gave a dry smile, his expression hard to read, like he was\nunable to decide what countenance to put forth.\n“No, if something isn’t to my satisfaction, it’s on me this time. The upper limit\non your magic program construction scope has leveled up beyond my\nexpectations. Because of that, your CAD’s processing power can’t keep up with\nyour magical power. I thought I’d given it some room to grow when I set it up,\nbut…I didn’t think far enough ahead.”\n“I’m sorry…” she sighed, hanging her head.\n“Why are you sorry? You should be proud.” Tatsuya tousled her hair, and\nwhen she looked up, he smiled gently.\nInfected by the smile, or in response to it, she gave her own smile as well,\nwhich was all well and good, but…\n…You’re not supposed to blush for that.\nSensing danger in the silence—mainly from her chest peeking through the\ngown seam—Tatsuya continued, his words somewhat hurried, “It looks like Lina\nbeing in your class is a good incentive for you.”\nThe instant Lina’s name came out, the mist dispersed from the flushed\nMiyuki’s eyes.\n“Yes… This may be forward of me, but I’ve never had anyone as strong as her\nto go up against.”\nAnd this wasn’t because he’d offended her. Miyuki wasn’t an unreasonable\ngirl—she wouldn’t flare up whenever she heard another girl’s name come out\nof Tatsuya’s mouth. The sense of transparency she gave off, which made even\nher expression look cold, was rooted in a different cause.\nCurrently, her eyes were filled with a quiet fighting spirit. “By the way,\nBrother, your question of her at lunch—I would presume, well…”\n“It was that obvious, huh?” said Tatsuya with a chuckle before erasing his\nsmile. “Yes, I do believe Lina is Sirius,” he announced plainly. “I really can’t hide\nanything from you, can I?”\nAs Tatsuya brought up his hands and smiled again, Miyuki’s expression",

Miyuki watches you more than anyone else,\nBrother.”\nTatsuya seemed to force himself to laugh, but was it because he thought it\nwas a joke, or because he’d decided to make it one?\nAs she laughed along with her brother, she thought to herself that she\nwanted to know how he really felt.\nThe basement (or perhaps one should say “underground facility”) was climate\ncontrolled, but both of them would be restless with her in just underwear and a\ngown. After Miyuki changed out of her dressing gown, they moved to the living\nroom.\nCovering her slender legs were neither black leggings nor tights, but long\nsocks. Her skirt hem was gently ruffled out and very short, and between it and\nher socks, her fair skin came in and out of sight.\nIf she was wearing that while standing upright, and then sat down or bent\nforward, wouldn’t that be fairly bad? That’s what Tatsuya thought, without\nthinking too hard about what exactly would be “bad.”\nIn ignorance of her brother’s thoughts—though he had no way of verifying\nwhether she really didn’t know—Miyuki placed a coffee cup in front of him,\nand, just for today, sat down not next to him but on the sofa across from him.\nThen, she did nothing so free-spirited as crossing her legs.\nShe put her knees properly together, leaning them at an angle.\nIt was a considerably sexier pose than one that would have given him a peek\nunder her skirt.\nTatsuya, who didn’t understand Miyuki’s intent (though he may have\nunderstood her surface intent, he didn’t know what lay behind it), decided not\nto make her any more flushed.\nAs soon as he decided not to concern himself with it, the instability vanished\nfrom his eyes.\nHe got a quick glimpse of a somewhat dissatisfied look from Miyuki across the",
  "page_71": "table, but he simply looked at her and spoke.\n“Getting back to the previous topic, I believe with high certainty that Lina is\nAngie Sirius.”\nTwo months ago, while the Stars—the USNA Army’s magician force—was\ninvestigating the truth behind his strategic spell Material Burst, he’d received a\nwarning from his aunt, Maya Yotsuba. At the time, she had also spoken of the\nfact that he and Miyuki had been designated targets of the Stars’ information\nwar as suspects. Tatsuya had been thinking Lina transferring to First High was\npart of that initiative.\n“What I don’t understand is how they don’t seem to be trying to hide Sirius’s\nidentity whatsoever. It almost seems as though they’re trying to get us to\nrealize.”\nIt was only natural he wouldn’t understand. Even Tatsuya couldn’t have\nspeculated the reason was that Lina’s personal—or rather, mental—guard was\nmore lax than even the USNA Army imagined.\n“And…” If he’d known the truth, laughing would have been his only recourse,\nbut he continued his deduction, expression serious.\n“Why would the USNA send in Sirius, who is essentially their trump card?”\nMiyuki had already switched mental gears and answered her brother seriously.\n“That’s right,” Tatsuya remarked. “Simply based on our observations this\nweek, Lina’s abilities don’t seem to be geared toward espionage work. Their\ntrue intentions probably lie elsewhere, but using her as their spy, of all people?”\n“Sirius is too important…”\n“If we assume that Lina is Sirius…then her spy mission would be secondary.\nTheir real mission is something else.”\n“But what on earth could be so important that the USNA would send Sirius\noutside the country?”\nAt this point, they were overthinking things. Though, they had no way of\nknowing that.\n“I don’t know…but I don’t think we need to let it bother us at this stage.”",
  "page_72": "From an omnipotent viewpoint, his deduction was off the mark; but as it\ncame out of Tatsuya’s mouth, his tension suddenly deflated— “America’s done\nus the honor of providing you with a rival, Miyuki.”\n—but that wasn’t to say that his seriousness disappeared as well. In fact, his\nvoice was earnest.\n“Yes, Brother,” answered Miyuki in a formal tone, to his equally earnest gaze.\n“Compete with Lina with everything you have. I know what I said before, but\nif she’s going to get caught up with wins and losses, that will work in your favor.\nIt will help push you to greater heights.”\n“Yes.”\n“Lina stands to grow just as much from competing with you. But you don’t\nhave to worry about that. This sort of chance rarely comes.”\nAt his firm instructions, Miyuki gave a quiet smile without a single shadow of\nunease. “Yes,” she said. “And I have you, Brother. As long as you do me the\nhonor of remaining at my side, I have nothing to fear—not even Sirius.”\nTatsuya had meant what he’d said in the sense of a competition partner, not\na true opponent.\nHe couldn’t deny that he felt Miyuki’s words were slightly off-kilter.\nBut at the unflinching trust she showed in him, he nodded without hesitation.\nAfter-school hours for Tatsuya came in many variations, but they had two\nmain patterns—either he shut himself up in the school’s library, or he patrolled\nthe halls as a disciplinary committee member. Usually, in the latter case, a\nveritable barrage of events occurred.\nEnough to make him think it was actually a conspiracy.\nAnd on this day, he felt that way more strongly than ever before.\nDisciplinary committee members were granted the special right to carry their\nCADs on their person at all times, but aside from when he was doing a job for\nthe committee, Tatsuya didn’t use that right.",
  "page_73": "CADs were originally tools for activating typed spells in a short time; although\nthey could be used with other magic, such as typeless magic, outer magic, and\nold magic, when it came to simple things—especially in typeless magic’s case,\nsuch as simply emitting psions—forgoing a CAD wouldn’t restrict a person very\nmuch.\nTatsuya, who had himself revealed at the Nine School Competition—\nunfortunately—that he could use dismantling magic, was mainly using typeless\nmagic outside class during the second term. That suited his purposes quite\nnicely, so there was no practical need for him to carry a CAD.\nStill, he equipped himself with the disciplinary committee’s spare CADs when\npatrolling, mainly as an intimidation tactic, since you couldn’t make light of a\nCAD even if using it was a feint. So, before going on indoors patrol, Tatsuya\nwould stop by the disciplinary committee office and wrap one around each arm.\nHe’d made a habit of it.\nAs usual, after classes had ended this day, he’d walked to the disciplinary\ncommittee HQ—only to find Lina there. Even from a distance, there was no\nmistaking her beautiful golden locks. The premonition of trouble on the job\nalmost made him do a U-turn, but he suppressed the impulse and made an\neffort to speak to her like normal.\n“Good morning.”\nHe’d gotten used to how the disciplinary committee members greeted\neveryone with that regardless of the time of day. He slipped through the crowd\nof people—well, at a glance, there were only five—and quickly ran through his\npreparations.\n“Ah, Shiba, hold on.”\nTragically, though, Kanon caught him. He didn’t let the despair show on his\nface; such were the benefits (?) of his daily training here.\n“What is it?”\nHis voice carried an utter lack of both subjective and objective enthusiasm.\nThe fact that Kanon didn’t care one bit about that, though, was both one of her\ncharming points and one of her flaws.",
  "page_74": "“You know Shields here, right?”\nA conclusion in the form of a question. Tatsuya had no choice but to nod, of\ncourse.\n“She wants to observe the disciplinary committee’s activity; she says she\nwants to see the way Japan’s magic high school students govern themselves.\nYou’re on duty today, right, Shiba? Could you take her along with you?”\nIf you want to make this harder for me, Tatsuya thought. He didn’t know\nLina’s intent, but he felt there was a high chance of something truly\ntroublesome happening. That was clear, considering all the male students\nsurrounding Lina (who were all upperclassmen) were currently giving him very\nunamused looks. Being in the disciplinary committee would spare him from any\njealous stares for the moment, but if he paraded around the halls side by side\nwith Lina, he couldn’t even begin to guess at the beds of nails he’d fall onto\nafterward. However, there was enough rationale behind Tatsuya being picked\nfor the request itself, so…\n“All right.”\nThere was no choice for Tatsuya but to give up and accept it.\nShe’d only just transferred in, so this wasn’t particularly surprising, but it\nwould be his first time alone with Lina. Students roamed the school building, so\nstrictly speaking they wouldn’t be completely alone, but the awkwardness\nwould remain, regardless of how popular she was.\nIn Tatsuya’s defense, it wasn’t going to be awkward for him because Lina was\ndrop-dead gorgeous. It was because Lina wasn’t completely hiding the fact that\nshe’d come to scope him out. She might have been intending to conceal her\nstolen glances at him, but from his point of view, it was all out in the open.\nStill, it wasn’t as though Tatsuya could come out and call her a spy, so the\nmurky stress kept on piling up inside him like the ashes from a volcano.\n“Did the school you went to not have a system like this?”\nBut he couldn’t retreat into silence forever, either (even though they’d only\ngone some ten yards away from the disciplinary committee office at this point).\nWondering why the quiet felt so heavy, he did something unusual and did her",
  "page_75": "the favor of bringing up the topic himself—though thinking calmly on it, it was a\npretty mean-spirited question.\n“Huh? Umm…”\nHe only realized it was mean when he saw Lina clearly at a loss.\nHe’d heard that the various people who were Sirius were traditionally combat\nmagicians who stuck purely to the front lines; Lina, at the very least, probably\nhadn’t received any espionage training whatsoever. Tatsuya started to feel very\nwhatever about the situation.\n“…I guess a freshman wouldn’t really know about that stuff.”\nHe started to feel sorry watching Lina like that, so he gave her a little help. He\ndidn’t need to expose her identity, and he’d rather she not get defiant.\n“W-well, no, they wouldn’t. I wanted to know more about how this school\ndoes things, since they let you be a part of these activities in your first year.”\nShe had a slight susceptibility to letting on too much about herself, but this\npart of her made Tatsuya think she was smart.\nEven though it was after the fact, she connected the pieces.\nShe might be even more quick-witted than my sister…\nAs expected, the piercing eyes stung, but nobody actually resorted to force,\nperhaps realizing they couldn’t show any shameful behavior to the transfer\nstudent.\nWith Lina in tow, he patrolled mainly the practice rooms and the science labs.\nHe explained them to her like it was just another tour of the school.\nAt the edge of the special lab building, where it descended into the back\nschoolyard, Lina stopped.\n“Are you tired? Should we go back?”\nOf course, he knew she hadn’t stopped for something like that. He just\ndecided to say it as a way into conversation.\n“No, I’m fine,” came the reply, somewhat stiffly.\n“What is it?” he prompted.",
  "page_76": "Lina pushed her hesitation away. “Tatsuya, you’re an alternate—a Course\nTwo, right?”\n“Yes, why?”\nIt had been a long time since someone had said that to his face. Rather than\ngiving him that not again feeling, it actually felt new to him, so he asked what\nshe meant by it.\n“I was wondering why your uniform is different from everyone in Class A.\nMiyuki sounded unhappy when she explained it.”\nAs though remembering it, Lina let out a giggle. It was, indeed, a very Miyuki-\nlike episode, and Tatsuya could only smile painfully.\n“But when I asked Kanon, she said you were top class in First High when it\ncame to the real thing.”\nThe way she pronounced the name sounded like cannon to Tatsuya’s ears—\ninstead of kah-nohn—but he decided to interpret it not as cannon but as canon,\nas in the hymn, which would make more sense given the mystical origins of the\nname, and ignored it—he would feel bad for Kanon if it was the former.\nBecause he was thinking about unnecessary things, he was late understanding\nwhat Lina was trying to say.\n“Tatsuya, why are you pretending to be a poor student—an Irregular? And\nwhy do you show your true strength so easily? It’s like everything you do is all\njumbled up. I just don’t get why you act like that.”\nHe listened to the end and finally understood what she meant. “I don’t know\nwhat Chiyoda told you, but I’m not pretending. I really am a poor student.”\nFortunately, thanks to her explaining her question so well, it wasn’t much\nwork to put together an answer, but if she hadn’t, it could have been a major\nhole in his facade. I should refrain from thinking about unnecessary things, he\nthought.\n“The practical skill tests evaluate speed, scope, and intensity. The test is based\non the international standard. But in real combat, those three things aren’t the\nonly things that decide if you win or lose. After all, physical ability is an",
  "page_77": "important factor in battle, too. What I mean is, I might be a poor student when\nit comes to the practical testing, but I’m good in a fight.”\nThat was the excuse he always used—but it was also the undebatable truth.\nTatsuya had no doubt this would wrap everything up nicely for her, or let him\noff the hook, at least.\n“…I agree. I think test-taking skill and real skill are different things.”\nSo Lina saying that was completely unexpected. What was she getting at?\n“In the future, I’d like to be a magician who can be useful in real combat, not\njust a bright student.”\nAn aura of dubiousness began to waver around Lina.\n“How disquieting.” The warmth—the heat—from Tatsuya’s eyes vanished.\n“Oh, you understand? That’s amazing.” Presented with his gaze of ice, or\nrather steel, Lina gave a brilliant smile.\nNot a flowerlike smile, but one with the kind of beauty a sharpened blade\nmight have.\nLina’s hand shot upward.\nTatsuya saw the heel of her palm fly at him. With minimal movement, he\ncaught her right hand, thrust sharply out, by its wrist. The palm strike aimed at\nhis jaw was stopped in front of his throat.\nLina made her right hand into a finger gun and shoved her index finger up. A\nfinely shaped nail plunged toward his face.\nTatsuya twisted Lina’s right hand to the outside.\nHer face clenched, and the psionic light gathering at her outstretched\nfingertip dispersed before firing.\n“That was dangerous.”\n“I thought I could get away.”\n“I hope you’re ready to explain yourself.”\n“Could you let go of me first? This kind of hurts. And it’s a little embarrassing",
  "page_78": "to stand like this.”\nBecause he’d twisted her hand up and out to the side, the distance between\nTatsuya and Lina’s bodies had closed a fair bit. Depending on your perspective,\ntheir position might make it look like he was assaulting her—like he was forcing\na kiss on her.\nAs soon as she said so, Tatsuya let go of her hand…but not a fragment of\nembarrassment was on his face.\n“That really hurt. It… Well, it didn’t bruise. How did you control your power\nlike that?” As she rubbed her right wrist with her left hand, she rolled up her\nsleeve, then made her surprise evident.\n“You tried to bust a hole in my face. I would think a little bit of pain is only\nnatural in return.”\n“It was just a clump of psionic particles. It wasn’t physically lethal. At most, it\nwould just make you feel like you’d been shot.”\n“And that isn’t enough of a reason for me to treat you roughly?”\nShe’d given him an ingratiating smile, but his expression didn’t loosen.\nLina sighed and held up her hands. “All right, I get it. Please, I beg your\nforgiveness for my rudeness, good sir Tatsuya.”\nShe bowed politely to him, renewing her attitude. When she looked back up,\nthere was an odd twist in Tatsuya’s lips, which had been tightly drawn back\nuntil now.\n“…Something else?”\n“…No, don’t mind me. And could you speak normally? When you pretend to\nbe elegant like that, you’re like a different person.”\nThe twist at the corners of Tatsuya’s mouth seemed to be because he didn’t\nthink it suited her.\n“Are you saying I’m not elegant?!”\n“It’s out of character.”\nHe was slightly worried that she wouldn’t understand his usage of the",
  "page_79": "Japanese loanword kyara for character, but he decided she was fluent enough\nwith Japanese that it wouldn’t be a problem and saved himself the trouble of\nrephrasing.\nAnd, for better or worse, she understood without an issue: “That isn’t true! I\nwas invited to have tea with the president once, you know!” she cried, letting\nherself get carried away as she emphasized just how “high society” she was.\n“Really, now…” smirked Tatsuya upon hearing it. A chilling aura emanated\nfrom his grin.\nLina reflexively covered her mouth. The expression Tatsuya had just given her\nlooked like the smile of Mephistopheles.\n“The president, hm…?”\nMany people in power avoided magicians who could kill without a weapon. In\nJapan, this barrier around politicians was actually less overbearing than other\nplaces; there were some countries where magicians were forbidden to come\ncloser than a set distance to politicians unless they voluntarily imbibed a slow-\nacting poison that could only be treated with regular periodic administrations of\nan antidote.\nAs for magicians who could meet the president of the USNA personally…\n“You tricked me, didn’t you…?”\nLina glared at him, frustrated. But she’d read too far into it.\n“You wound me. The conversation going that way was pure coincidence. In\nfact, this was more like you self-destructing, wasn’t it? You were the one who\nattacked me, after all.”\nThis is what it meant to be at a loss for words. The only thing Lina could do\nwas continue staring, mortified, at him.\n“And? Would you explain why you did something like that?”\n“…I wanted to know how skilled you are.”\n“How skilled I am? For what?” He frowned, dubious.\nLina looked away. “Nothing, really… Just curious.”",
  "page_80": "“Curious… Let’s leave it at that, then, shall we?” said Tatsuya, having seen\nthrough her clear evasion.\nShe sniffed, as though sulking. “…If I must say,” she began, moving her gaze\nback to him. “I was wondering if you’d come to the States.”\n“Me? To America?”\n“If you don’t get good grades even though you’re really good, I just thought\nmaybe you’d want to be somewhere where you could be seen as better for\nwhat you do. The international standard is the mainstay in the States for\nmagician ranks, too, but not in certain places. The USNA is a free country, and\nit’s even more diverse. You would be able to get the evaluation you deserve.”\n“That’s a very interesting thought.” The unexpected invitation seemed to\nhave softened Tatsuya’s attitude slightly.\nLina pressed on, sensing it was working. “Then—”\n“If I can take that at face value.” But Tatsuya spoiled her enthusiasm with a\nsardonic tone. “Lina, where exactly do they not use the mainstay for\nmeasurement? Are you talking about Arlington?”\nArlington, once a military academy, was now the biggest supply of magicians\nand magic engineers for the USNA Army.\n“…Yes. But that’s not the only—”\n“Lina, standards of evaluation are for choosing who is right for a specific\npurpose.” But though Tatsuya’s tone may have been cold, there was none of\nthe skin-crawling chill in it. “In the sense of choosing suitable magicians for the\narmed forces, Arlington isn’t all that different than Japan’s National Defense\nAcademy. Though I suppose they have a wider reach.”\nIf anything, he looked as though he were teasing a friend.\n“Well, whatever.”\n“Huh…?”\nAnd then, suddenly, he muttered, sounding like he really didn’t care about\nany of this.",

That, of course, would be better for Lina. But she couldn’t\nfigure his intentions in doing such a thing.\nTatsuya had said he wouldn’t question her, but even knowing she might bring\nhis goodwill to naught, she couldn’t help but ask the question.\n“Ask what?”\n“Ask what…? Like my identity… You don’t want to make sure of it?”\n“I don’t care. There’s plenty of things in the world people are better off not\nknowing.”\nLina couldn’t tell if that was self-concealment or what he truly felt.

The automatic cars and one-person transport trains\noperated all twenty-four hours of the day. And in a big city like Shibuya, you\ndidn’t even have to use shared vehicles; the powered walking paths strung\nabout underground would get you to the station quickly.\nAnd now that the infrastructure for working from home had been\nstreamlined, there was almost no reason to cling to an office until the late\nhours.

However, the boycott of foreigners ended\nmore quickly, actually allowing this city to avoid the complete destruction the\nothers had seen. But because of that, the government had left the place in a\nlawless state at night, so it would be hard to say which was the better deal.\nHad it been a lawless zone both day and night, the government—now less\ntolerant of disorder than before the war—would have proceeded with its\n“redevelopment.” Current administrative authorities had grown quite bold\nwhen it came to the limitations of private rights regarding real estate.\nBut Shibuya had a completely different face during the day.\nWhen the sun was up, it was a city for business, where respectable employees\ncame and went in a hurry.\nWhen the moon was out, it was a nightlife district where young wannabe\noutlaws roamed.\nUnable to sink their hands into it all at once, the related authorities still\nhadn’t gotten anywhere with redevelopment.\nAnd tonight, once again, not long after the New Year, a large number of\nyoung people were gathered on the streets, living it up everywhere you looked,\nlaughing with, flirting with, and punching one another.\nAmong them was a strapping young man with features that cut deeply into\nhis face.\nHis outfit so light you wouldn’t think it was the middle of winter—a sweatshirt\nwith a jumper over it—Leo floated aimlessly through the midnight Shibuya\nstreets.

No, not a hobby—more like a habit.\nHe was a wanderer.\nHe didn’t walk, run, or shout—he wandered the night.\nThe closer it got to midnight, the more he wanted to float about with no\ndestination.\nLeo considered it an instinct carved into his genes.\nGermany had been the first country in the world to realize magician\nconditioning technology based on genetic engineering, and he was part of the\nthird generation of the original line developed, the Fortress—or Jousai—series.\nThe Burg Folge was a series of engineered magicians developed with an\nemphasis on physical durability. At the time, close combat was thought to be a\nweakness of magicians, so they were genetically modified not to increase their\nmagic powers, but to bolster their physical abilities. They weren’t so much\nengineered magicians as super-soldiers who could use magic, or perhaps, an\nenhanced human who could use both superhuman physical abilities and magic\ntechniques.\nDespite the engineering methods not including ways to deal with chimerism,\nit wasn’t difficult to imagine scientists using a far stronger and larger mammal\nthan humans as a reference for the genetic modifications.\nThey hadn’t removed the Burg Folge body limiters from the outside—that\ntype of measure was already known to result in a high chance of loss of magical\ncapability—but instead raised his body’s abilities themselves.\nPerhaps as a result of such forceful genetic modification, many of that first\nBurg Folge generation died at very young ages, and even those that did grow up\nmostly went crazy and died.\nOne of the few survivors had been Leo’s grandfather.\nAnd because of that, Leo held a fear inside him.\nYou certainly wouldn’t think it, looking at him from the outside, but he lived\nhis life with a terror in the furthest reaches of his mind.",

Just loud enough to make the person\nhe’d just passed aware that he was there. Nevertheless, glances gathered on\nhim from the sides of the road, none of them particularly favorable.\n“Could you come with us?” answered the man walking next to “Erika’s\nbrother” as he gave a bitter face. He knew this man’s face, too; it would be a\nlittle hard for him to call the man young, but he remembered. Not only his face,\nbut his name.",

What do you need all of a sudden, sir?”\nWithout answering his question, which could have been dubbed rude, Inagaki\ngrabbed Leo’s wrist.\nIt would have been easy to shake the man off, but Leo obediently followed.\nThey took him to a small bar down an alley. The sign out front had the word\nBAR in English on it, but given the place’s look, Leo didn’t feel they had any need\nto use English.\n“Bartender, we’re borrowing the upstairs room.”\nWithout waiting for an answer from the bar’s owner, who was polishing\nglasses on the other side of the counter, they went up the stairs right in front of\nthem. The men brought Leo into a cramped room; it only had a small round\ntable and four chairs inside, but it felt filled to the brim. The door was a thick\none with an airtight structure, like an air lock on a spaceship, but it went terribly\nwith the antique furniture inside.\n“I’m a minor, you know.”\nRight before Inagaki could open his mouth after turning the air lock’s handle\nwith both hands and making sure the door was firmly locked, Leo took the\ninitiative, voice sounding innocent.\nAs Inagaki made a sour face, Toshikazu Chiba looked amused—not like he was\nhaving fun, but like he found this interesting—and laughed.\n“Saijou, right? I’m surprised you recognized us. We were concealing our\npresence pretty well.”\nWith just that, Leo realized what Toshikazu hadn’t said. “…Did I obstruct an\ninvestigation?”\nHis sharpness seemed to catch Toshikazu off guard. “Well, well… You aren’t\njust muscle. Well, I guess Erika wouldn’t have helped you if you were just a\nmeathead.”\nLeo scowled reflexively, but goodwill versus malice aside, he knew she’d\nhelped him a lot by teaching him techniques and lending him a weapon, so he\ndidn’t argue anything aloud.",

We were only concealing\nourselves to avoid pointless trouble, not because we were tailing anyone.\nOfficers aren’t looked upon kindly around here at night.”\n“Yeah… You’re right about that,” said Leo, nodding deeply and a little\nsympathetically.\nThe sharp gaze Inagaki was giving Leo changed into a somewhat friendlier\none. “Chief, isn’t this a good stroke of luck? What do you say we ask him?”\nLeo obviously didn’t understand what he meant by only that, but he didn’t\nhurry them for an explanation. Toshikazu nodded, then turned back to him; Leo\nwaited calmly.\n“Saijou, what might you be in Shibuya for today?”\n“Nothing in particular, sir.”\n“Hmm. Do you come here a lot?”\n“Not really a lot, sir, but I come here every once in a while. I think I was\nwandering around here on New Year’s Eve, too.”\n“Two weeks ago… Then would you know of any strange incidents happening\nin the city’s downtown area?”\nInagaki didn’t stop Toshikazu, even though he was about to give details about\nan incident under media blackout. He knew they’d scoop the story up by\ntomorrow anyway.\n“Strange incidents, sir? They happen basically every day. By the way, weren’t\nyou stationed in Yokohama, Chief? How come you’re investigating incidents in\nTokyo?”",
  "page_88": "“We belong to the Ministry of Police. We get bumped around Japan. This\ntime, we’re investigating a string of freak deaths happening in the city.”\nThe words flowed out, light and smooth. But Leo wasn’t disturbed by the\ntone.\n“Freak deaths… A psychotic killer? And serial?” he asked, frowning.\nToshikazu adjusted his opinion of Leo upward without letting it show on his\nface. “That’s right. I mean, you’ll know tomorrow anyway, so…” He trailed off,\nexchanging glances with Inagaki.\nInagaki nodded, then took a cell phone out of his suit’s inside pocket. Opening\nthe foldable device, he called up an image file on the screen. When Leo saw the\nimages slide past one by one, he gulped.\n“The most recent victim was three days ago, discovered in the park on\nDougen Hill. Estimated time of death is somewhere from one AM to two AM.”\n“Right smack in the heart of the city?”\nHe thought “right smack in the heart of the city” sounded strange, but Leo\ncouldn’t think of any other words to more appropriately express his state of\nmind.\nWeren’t freak incidents supposed to happen deep in the mountains, far from\ncivilization?\n“This might be the heart of the city during the day, but it’s Shibuya—anything\ncan happen here at night.”\nBut after Toshikazu gave a bitter response, all he could do was nod—he was\nright. Leo knew personally how strangely two-faced Shibuya was these days.\n“Getting to the point… Seen any strange people lately? I don’t mind if you’ve\nonly heard rumors.”\n“Everyone wandering around this city at night is strange. What kind of person\nexactly are you looking for?”\nLeo’s remark was valid, and Toshikazu let out a pained grin, even though he\nknew it wasn’t the time. “You’re right. But if we knew anything about the\ncriminal, the investigation would be going a lot more smoothly…”",

He didn’t move to stop his superior from\nrevealing investigative secrets to a civilian, either.\n“They all died from emaciation. All seven had no external wounds\nwhatsoever.”\n“No external wounds? Poison?” asked Leo, expression changing.\nToshikazu shook his head. “As far as is known, they’re all clean for drugs, too.\nAnd despite having no external wounds, approximately ten percent of their\nblood was missing from their bodies.”\n“All of them?”\n“All of them.”\n“I see… Yeah, definitely freak deaths. This is more like a mystery incident than\na psycho killer,” sighed Leo, letting neither fear nor unease show.\n“It might look like an unnatural phenomenon, but in reality, these were\ncrimes committed.” Feeling perplexed at his attitude, Toshikazu went back to\nhis original line of questioning. “Anyway, would you happen to know anyone\nwho seems like they’d pull occult stuff like this? Especially people who have\nrecently come from elsewhere, someone particularly rumored about.”\n“People who came here recently…” Leo groaned, his arms folded before the\nquestion came out, until finally he unfolded them, a look of resignation on his\nface. “Sorry, can’t think of any at the moment.”\nHis tone was rough—no, disorderly, as though saying, Manners? What are\nthose? But strangely enough, it didn’t feel mean.\n“I can go ask some friends, sir.”\n“Huh? Oh, no, you don’t need to do that. That’s the police’s job, and whoever\nthis is might mark you if you start sniffing around.”\n“…Well, I suppose, but…”",

I may not look it, but I’ve got a\ngood sense of smell.”\n“Really? Well, all right.”\n“Chief?!”\nStill, letting a high school student aid the investigation was going too far; it\nwas too dangerous. Inagaki thought so, at least, panicking until his boss reached\nout to stop him. Then he brought a business card out of his pocket.\n“If you find anything out, send me a text. You’ll only need to put in the key\nonce; after that, it will automatically update.”\nToshikazu and Leo both ignored the lieutenant’s better sense.\n“Pretty strict, eh?

I hope humanist trends don’t get stronger from this,”\nMizuki muttered darkly.\nModern humanism was, broadly speaking, a form of discrimination against\nmagicians.\nA movement trying to ban magic usage based on the teachings of a minor\nChristian sect (perhaps heretical sect would be a more appropriate term), it\nstated that magic was not a power humans were allowed to have.\nBecause of their statement that “Man should live with only the power he is\nafforded,” they were named the humanists and had expanded their influence in\nrecent years in the heart of America’s East Coast.\nIf they simply said “We’re not using magic,” then there would be no harm\ndone, but radical humanists had engaged in several violent acts against the very",

What’re we talking about?”\nOverlapping Erika’s words and interrupting was, as always, the one who sat in\nfront of Tatsuya—there was no homeroom teacher to suggest seat changes, so\nit was no wonder—Leo.\n“You’re late today, aren’t you?” Tatsuya asked, lifting his hand to respond to\nhis classmate’s abbreviated greeting. Though his appearance might have given\nyou other ideas, it was rare for Leo to slide into the room right before classes\nstarted.\n“Yeah, I was up late doing stupid chores… Anyway, what were you talking\nabout?”\n“The vampire incident everyone’s talking about,” answered Mizuki.\nLeo’s face scrunched up. Tatsuya thought he heard the word again come\nmuttered from his mouth, but just then, the message indicating the start of first\nperiod appeared on their terminals, and he had to end the idle gossip without\nasking.\nMiyuki appeared in the cafeteria with no blonde-haired companion next to\nher.\nLina hadn’t promised to be there, so Tatsuya didn’t harbor any doubts or\ndissatisfactions about it. Thus, the remark he made was less because he was\ncurious and more because it simply came to mind first.\n“I see Lina’s not with you today.”\nBut his little sister’s answer was outside Tatsuya’s expectations. “She’s absent\ntoday, Brother. She said an urgent family matter came up.”\n“Really…?”\nAbsent so early on in the exchange program? thought Tatsuya, but he didn’t\nknow any magician transfer students aside from her, so he couldn’t say for sure",
  "page_96": "it was abnormal. Besides, if he was right about her true identity, she would\nhave many things to prioritize over school. And she wouldn’t have told Miyuki\nor Honoka anything other than that it was “a family matter,” either. So Tatsuya\ndidn’t inquire any further.\nErika and Mizuki acted as though it was on their minds—of course, the\ndifference was that Mizuki was worried and Erika was curious—but they, too,\nknew there was no reason they’d get an answer if they asked Miyuki. Instead,\nthe same as always, the seven, with one missing (not Lina, but Shizuku), sat\ndown around the table.\n“Come to think of it, is Shizuku doing all right?” said Erika, looking at Honoka.\n“Yes, she seems to be doing fine. And she said her classes aren’t very hard,”\nHonoka replied promptly, not feeling any doubts about it—with modern\ncommunication infrastructure, the Pacific Ocean didn’t separate them by very\nmuch. “She did say she was surprised that they still had discussion-style classes\nwhere the teacher participated, though.”\nEveryone gave surprised and curious reactions to this episode. Studying\nabroad was practically nonexistent for students of magic, so they got almost no\ninformation about what kinds of classes were held in other countries.\n“I wonder if Lina is having trouble with things here, then.”\n“It doesn’t seem like it.”\nMiyuki smiled even as she rebutted her friend’s concerns. In reality, Lina\ndidn’t seem inconvenienced by the difference between American and Japanese\nclass structures. Miyuki’s smile was cold, her tone purposefully crafted to make\nit sound like Lina had never gone to anything but a Japanese magic high school\nto begin with.\nHer coquettish, devilish smile fortunately wasn’t spotted by anyone else.\nTheir friends’ attentions were soon glued to Honoka’s next bombshell remark—\nor rather, bombshell news.\n“We talked about it a little on the phone yesterday, but Shizuku was surprised\nat the news of the vampire incident, too. She says something similar is\nhappening in America, too.”",
  "page_97": "“What?! Is that true?”\n“I asked Shizuku the same thing. Apparently it’s happening around Dallas in\nthe mid-South, though, not on the West Coast where she is.”\n“That’s the first I’ve heard of it…” said Tatsuya in a surprised and impressed\ntone—he’d been diligently checking on all USNA-related news recently,\nconsidering the warning he’d gotten from his aunt.\n“They’re putting a lot of information control on it over there, too. Shizuku\ndidn’t hear about it from the news; she heard it from a well-informed student\nat the school she’s going to,” explained Honoka with a bashful smile, as though\nhappy she’d drawn Tatsuya’s interest.\nAs he nodded, there was a light in his eyes, too strong to be standard\ncuriosity.\nWhile Tatsuya and the others were talking up a storm about their friend in\nAmerica, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed high school student who had come there\nto study abroad was in the middle of a meeting at the USNA embassy.\n“What you mean is, a neural structure never seen in normal humans had\nformed in Freddy’s—rather, Lieutenant Fomalhaut’s cerebral cortex?”\nThe meeting was eating into her lunchtime, but nobody, including her,\ninsisted on a break.\n“The term normal human may invite misunderstanding.” The one who\nanswered was, despite not wearing the white coat, a man who looked very\nmuch like a scientist. “The autopsy turned up a neural structure we’ve never\nobserved in any human’s cerebral cortex before, including magicians, in Alfred\nFomalhaut’s cerebrum. More concretely, a formation similar to a small-scale\ncorpus callosum had formed in his prefrontal cortex.”\nSeeing that many of those in the meeting were giving him muddled\nexpressions (including Lina), the scientist began to explain again, this time in a\nmore lecturing manner.\n“You all know that a human’s brain is separated into a right hemisphere and a\nleft hemisphere, correct?”",
  "page_98": "After seeing everyone in attendance nod, he continued. “The two\nhemispheres are connected via the corpus callosum near the center of the\nbrain. In different terms, the only place an average person’s brain will have a\nstructure connecting the hemispheres is that place near the center.”\n“The prefrontal cortex is on the surface of the cerebrum… No structures are\nsupposed to connect the left and right brains on the surface, right?”\n“Correct. In other words, something a human shouldn’t have was in the brain\nof Lieutenant Fomalhaut.”\nLina finally grasped why they’d needed to call her here. This certainly wasn’t\nsomething they could have told her over normal channels.\n“What function could it serve, then? I’ve heard the prefrontal cortex is closely\nlinked to thinking and judgment… If new brain cells formed there, did they\naffect his thinking?”\n“Among us USNA magic scientists, there is support for a hypothesis that says\nthe brain isn’t an independent organ for thought, but rather one for\ncommunication, which receives information sent by psycheons. Pushions, as\nsome call them, are the true bodies of thought. In other words, the cerebrum\nreceives information from the mind, and can also transmit information about\nthe physical body to the mind.”\nThe scientist gave an insincere smile and shook his head at the question from\nthe high-ranking martial officer sitting across from him.\n“According to this hypothesis, the new neural construction that formed in\nLieutenant Fomalhaut’s cerebrum was a link to an unknown mental function\nthat has never before been downloaded.”\nThose at the meeting once again gave bewildered looks. Lina, who had been\nthinking carefully, raised her hand to speak.\n“What is it, Major?”\nThough prompted by the presenter, she couldn’t speak immediately. It was\nonly after three seconds had passed that her question passed from the rosy lips\nthat men couldn’t help but be drawn to.",
  "page_99": "“…Doctor, is it possible that unknown mental function is an unknown magic\ninterfering with the mind from outside?”\nThe scientist’s response was immediate. “I believe you’re asking whether\nLieutenant Fomalhaut could have been manipulated, but unfortunately, there is\nno such possibility. This may be a hypothesis, but there is no doubt to the idea\nthat the mind and body react to stimuli individually. You may be able to\ninfluence someone else’s mind, but it would never result in a structure forming\nin their brain. Unless the spell recreated the person’s mental structure itself.”\nThe idea of recreating someone’s very mental structure reminded Lina of the\nlegend of a certain magician. That magician, however, was already dead. She\nwas supposed to have passed away after a twenty-year hospitalization, without\never marrying or producing children.\nLina shook her head a little and reset her thought process.\nAfternoon classes were still being held, but seniors were already allowed to\nskip classes. With an uninterested eye toward the freshmen and juniors\nconfined to their classrooms and practice rooms, two seniors, one male and one\nfemale, had met in a club room with nobody else in it.\nThere was no amorous air about the room, though—even if their parents\nwere considering they marry one day. (Out of several possible choices, that\nwas.) The lack was only natural; this secret meeting may have been secret, but\nit was no rendezvous. Katsuto and Mayumi had come to this place representing\nthe Juumonji and Saegusa families.\n“I don’t know why we had to come all the way here, though.”\n“Sorry. I decided this way would be least conspicuous. As part of the Juumonji\nfamily, I’d like to avoid doing anything that would result in inciting the Yotsuba.”\n“Well, my family and the Yotsuba are in a state of cold war, present tense,\nsince two months ago. It’s all because that tanuki of a father is sticking his nose\nwhere he shouldn’t.”\nMayumi’s bitter remark caused Katsuto to crack a smile. “I didn’t know you\ncould talk that way, Saegusa.”",
  "page_100": "“Oh my, I’m so very sorry. Was that in bad taste?”\nHer overly theatrical flirtatiousness made his smile turn into a pained grin.\n“When I talk to you, sometimes I think I’m not being treated like a man.”\n“You misunderstand. Out of everyone I know, you’re the ace when it comes\nto manliness. It’s just…”\n“It wouldn’t develop into a relationship at this point.”\n“Well, we have been rivals for three years—ever since we enrolled.”\nAfter a short round of hushed chuckling from both of them, their faces got\nserious at the same time. There had been a heavy tension drifting between\nthem even while they were laughing, though, so the mood itself didn’t exactly\nchange.\n“Juumonji, I have a message from my father—rather, from Kouichi Saegusa,\ncurrent head of the Saegusa. We desire a coalition with the Juumonji family.”\n“That doesn’t sound peaceful. A coalition already, not just cooperation?”\nKatsuto pressed, his eyes asking for an explanation.\nMayumi, of course, was happy to explain as much as he needed to\nunderstand. “How much do you know of the vampire incident?” she asked.\n“Only what’s been reported. We don’t have as many pieces under our control\nas the Saegusa.”\nThat could be taken as modesty. Mayumi’s lips softened a little. “Your family\ndoes go for the whole one-man-army thing, after all. We may only have\nquantity, but as far as we know…” She paused suggestively.\nAnd before Katsuto could prompt her to continue, she added, “There are\nabout three times as many victims in this incident as they’re reporting. As of\nyesterday, we confirmed a twenty-fourth.”\nEven Katsuto couldn’t maintain his stoicism at that surprise. “…Is that just in\nthe Tokyo area?”\n“They’re all concentrated in the city—in the center of the city, in fact.”\nKatsuto folded his arms and thought about this. Mayumi waited wordlessly",
  "page_101": "for him to speak.\n“The Saegusa have information on victims the police don’t,” he said\neventually. “And the victims are only appearing in a small, limited area… Are the\nvictims related to the Saegusa?”\n“You’re half-right. All the victims the police don’t know about are magicians\nconnected to our family. Even the ones who aren’t a part of our family are\neither magicians or people with aptitude for magic. Students of the Magic\nUniversity, for example.”\n“Which means,” said Katsuto, expression turning grim, “the criminal is going\nafter magicians.”\n“…Juumonji, you’re scaring me a little.”\nApparently, his expression was a little too daunting for the female high school\nstudent to look at—leaving aside whether she was acting or telling the truth.",
  "page_103": "He grunted. “Sorry.”\nAnd even if it was an act, it was certainly effective enough to make him yield.\n“We don’t know if the serial killer is one person or several, but I think we’re\ncertain this ‘vampire’ is after magicians.”\nAs a sadness began to drift from Katsuto for some reason, Mayumi returned\nto the conversation without trying to help him out—her true character was still\nthat of a devil.\n“Chronologically,” she continued, “the Magic University students and faculty\nwere the first victims, and then they came after people connected to us when\nwe started investigating. And meanwhile, the victims were increasing\nregardless.”\n“You’re right. We can’t leave this be.” Katsuto nodded deeply, the damage\nhe’d received from Mayumi still showing at the edges of his expression. “Do we\nhave any clues? If they’re strong enough to harm Saegusa magicians, they must\neither be enhanced soldiers or magicians themselves. And it’s likely they’re\nfrom outside the country. Any suspicious foreigners who came to Japan around\nwhen the incidents started occurring, or at least to Tokyo?”\nMayumi shook her head. The Saegusa had probably already figured the same\nthing and looked into it. “But in terms of foreigners who came to Japan around\nthe time of the incidents’ beginning…”\nShe shut her mouth then, but as Katsuto urged her on with his eyes, she\ncontinued hesitantly. “Quite a few transfer students and magic engineers from\nthe USNA have entered the country. One of them came to our school as an\nexchange student, but… Juumonji, do you suspect her?”\n“She’s suspicious, but I don’t think she’s the criminal.” Katsuto’s answer was\nimmediate. “I don’t think she’s completely unrelated, but we should be able to\nleave her alone for the moment.”\n“If you say so…” Mayumi didn’t seem to be seriously suspecting Lina, either.\nShe lowered her eyes, showing a lack of confidence.\nKatsuto asked something that was on his mind: “But if this is the situation,",
  "page_104": "then I’d think we should cooperate with the Yotsuba as well.”\nThe suggestion made sense, but this time it was Mayumi’s turn to scowl. “To\ntell the truth, I think so, too…but we’re the ones who broke the rules. Unless my\nfather apologizes, I don’t think we’re going to repair relations with them.”\n“And your father has no intention of apologizing to the Yotsuba… I suppose I\nunderstand, considering the feud between Sir Kouichi and Lady Maya… Still, it’s\nunusual for the Yotsuba to be this hardened in their attitude.”\nAt best, the Yotsuba were on the road of sovereign independence, and at\nworst, on one of superior self-righteousness (not necessarily in a bad sense),\nand they had maintained a stance of not caring what the other families did.\nThey simply strove to improve their own capabilities as though possessed, and\ntheir position at the top of the Ten Master Clans with the Saegusa was\npredicated solely on their magical power. Even among the clans, they were an\noddity.\nKatsuto got the chills whenever he thought about what they were doing\nbehind the scenes, but nevertheless, as far as he knew, they would never show\nclear antagonism that would cause a fracture in the Master Clans Council. He\nwouldn’t say it to Mayumi, but the Saegusa were generally the ones who\nplanted those seeds, so to speak.\nHis thoughts about what could have happened must have been showing on\nhis face.\n“I don’t know the details, either, but…” Mayumi began reluctantly, “that\ntanuki of a father of mine secretly got into a certain section of the National\nDefense Force Army’s intelligence division that the Yotsuba have their hooks in.\nAnd they found him out…”\n“…I see.”\nIn that case, the Yotsuba’s firm stance made sense. Mayumi looked about to\nstart gnashing her teeth in frustration; Katsuto could only say those two words.\nShe was probably firing off ninety-nine abusive phrases at her father in her\nmind.\nAfter a short time passed, Mayumi eventually seemed to calm down, and she",
  "page_105": "turned to face Katsuto directly again. “What do you think?” she asked, tone\ncalmed as well. “Can we expect the Juumonji to fight alongside the Saegusa on\nthis?”\nKatsuto immediately nodded. “You can.”\n“I know you’re always quick to decide…but that really was fast,” sighed\nMayumi. He hadn’t shown a bit of hesitation.\n“Like I said before, now that I’ve heard the story, the Juumonji can’t leave the\nsituation alone, either.”\nOf course, her remark wasn’t enough to make him waver.",

That, however, did not apply to\nthe city of Shibuya at large.\nAs midnight approached, for a short time, there were places without any\npeople, like bugs eating away at the town.

Like this particular tree park, no bigger\nthan a parking space, with but a single bench in it.\nOf course, just because people weren’t passing by, that didn’t mean there\nwere no figures to be seen. Two of them, in fact, were in this park. One wore a\nlong coat, a scarf, and a round, wide-brimmed hat pulled over its eyes. It was\nthe sort of shadowy person you couldn’t tell the gender of, much less the\nfeatures. The other wore a stylish half coat with a knit sweater underneath, plus\nmini wrapped culottes and thick leggings—a young woman.\nRight after the hatted figure rose from its position covering the woman’s\ncorpse lying on the bench, a new figure spoke to them from behind.\nIncompatible again?\nA long coat, a scarf, and a hat. The figure wore the exact same thing as the\nfirst and spoke in a voice that didn’t vibrate the air.\nNo good. This time, I tried completely blocking the connection after sending a\ncopy in, but as with previous attempts, it simply absorbed the psions in the\nsample’s blood, then returned without anchoring.\nThe first answered the second in the same silent voice.

Just like how you are you. Nothing has changed.\nYes, you’re right… Hm?\nThe two figures ended their thought conversation and looked in the same\ndirection.\nSomeone has broken the psychic barrier. Two…no, three?\nI had strengthened the barrier because we were currently conducting trials.\nThey must possess quite high capacity.\nWe are two. Should we withdraw?\nNo, this is a rare opportunity.

He wasn’t actually that interested in who the criminal was.\nThe closest thing he could come up with was simply that he felt like he\ncouldn’t leave this alone.\nAfter searching his own feelings, that was the conclusion he arrived at.\nHe walked through the night. He plunged through the darkness. For a while\nnow, he’d been hearing an intermittent noise, like the sounds of bug wings\nflapping. Not in his ears—but crossing the very pit of his consciousness.\nHe didn’t know what it meant. Leo could only recognize it as mere noise. But\nhis gut told him it was voices talking.\nVoices trading words at the bottom of his consciousness, close to the region\nthat used magic. He drew ever nearer the transmission source, as though being\nsucked in.\nThe Stars were the core magical force of the USNA. But even so, not all\nAmerican magicians in the army belonged to the Stars. Of the three strategic-\nclass magicians currently recognized by the state, Angie Sirius was the only one\nassigned to the Stars. The other two were stationed at the Alaska base and the\nGibraltar base abroad.\nNevertheless, there was no denying that the Stars magicians were the central\naxis of magical combat for the USNA Army. In particular, the magicians granted\nfirst-magnitude code names made up the strongest magical force in the world.\nTherefore, the desertion of one of the first-magnitude magicians, Alfred\nFomalhaut, was a major shock to the USNA leadership. They couldn’t bring the\nincident to an end with the execution of Fomalhaut alone. They needed to deal\nwith every last one of the other fugitives and make an example of them.\nTwo people were walking quickly through the streets of Shibuya that night—\nUSNA Army hunters dispatched to deal with the fugitives. They belonged to\nStardust, a unit of magicians directly under the USNA Army Joint Chiefs of Staff,\nthe dust that couldn’t become stars. Still, they had combat power as magic",

On it, she called up a map and saw that this alley\nled straight to the park they’d detected Sullivan at. There was an entrance to\nthe right of their current location, as well as one around a right turn.\n“One signal. Let’s use a pincer.

Ever",
  "page_110": "since becoming his current self, he couldn’t hide anything from his compatriot.\nHe had virtually no privacy. But for the current Charles Sullivan, it wasn’t\nuncomfortable. It was only natural for them, and any reason he might have had\nto be uncomfortable was gone anyway.\nWhen he focused his mind on a spot behind his forehead, he could see the\nthoughts of all his companions. They shared his consciousness through a new\nantenna, which had grown between his right and left lobes. He was both the\nindividual known as Charles Sullivan and part of “them.”\nI see. If they only know me as a satellite-class, then I can predict what\nmeasures they’ll take. I won’t need backup.\nAfter Sullivan sent that thought out, a rustling noise returned to him, like the\nsounds of wings flapping inside a beehive.\nI will make preparations anyway, just to be sure.\nThe sounds took form as an answer given by his compatriot, hidden nearby.\nThe encounter happened a moment later.\n“Deimos Second, deserter. Put your hands in the air and open them.”\nA young woman’s voice called out to him from in front. At the same time, a\nsilent noise, like nails on a chalkboard, washed over him from behind.\nThe noise was psionic waves emitted by a Cast Jammer—a form of magical\ninterference using portable anti-magic weapons developed by the USNA Army\nMagic Research Division. The interfering waves from a Cast Jammer weren’t a\nnoise that indiscriminately blocked all magic like Cast Jamming, which used\nantinite. A Cast Jammer was a device that obstructed a CAD’s functions. By\nduplicating the psi-wave interference caused by using multiple CADs at once, it\nblocked the reading in of activation sequences. Normally, this interference\nwould only occur because of psi-waves from the same person, but owing to the\ndevelopment of technology to analyze an opponent’s psionic patterns, the\nUSNA Army had, though on a limited basis, succeeded in disabling CADs.\nNot everyone could use the equipment. Using a Cast Jammer required a high\nlevel of skill in typeless, psionic wave–emitting magic. Additionally, its effective\nfiring range was a mere five meters. However, as a means of jamming magic",
  "page_111": "without antinite, Cast Jammers were a revolutionary secret weapon for the\nUSNA Army.\nWith the muzzle pointed at him, Sullivan raised his hands over his head,\nopening his fingers, as instructed. The instruction, though it would have been\nincomprehensible to a normal person, was meant to prevent the use of CADs.\nAccording to the data the two women, both pursuers and executioners, had\nbeen given, Deimos Second couldn’t use magic without a CAD. His physical\nabilities were at most at the level of a regular soldier. If they simply blocked his\nmagic, then he would be no match for the women, both magicians and\nbiologically enhanced—or rather, that’s how it should have been.\n“The decision has been made to eliminate you on sight. However, if you’ll\nprovide information about the other deserters, our orders are to lower your\npunishment by one degree,” warned the hunter, her finger on the trigger.\nSullivan, hands still up, shrugged.\n“Deimos Second, we will give you ten seconds to consider.”\n“I don’t need it.”\nAs though confused by Sullivan’s response, which showed no nervousness,\nmuch less tension, she didn’t fire her bullet.\n“Stardust Chasers, Number 17, Number 18—Hunter Q and Hunter R, right?”\nWith her code name guessed right, Q’s relaxed finger tightened again.\n“Neither of you can defeat me.”\nAt the same time as Sullivan’s light remark came a gunshot. A suppressor\nsilenced the report so much it sounded like a toy air gun. However, the bullet\nfired was more than capable of taking a person’s life.\nA muffled scream went up behind Sullivan. The fired bullet, instead of striking\nSullivan’s chest, which was directly where the muzzle aimed, had instead bored\ninto Hunter R’s chest.\n“Didn’t you hear? You shouldn’t have used a gun against me,” explained\nSullivan in a tone like he was looking down on an inferior.\n“A trajectory distortion spell?!” came the astonished voice of Q. They knew he",

Both the hunters\ndrew knives from their coat sleeves, then charged at Sullivan at once, from in\nfront and behind.\nTheir thrusts were a product of their enhanced physical abilities, too fast for a\nnormal human to avoid. But Sullivan, who they were sure hadn’t undergone\nenhancement, fluttered this way and that, evading their strikes. His dodges\nweren’t solely due to athletic ability. R’s blade came at his neck; it curved\nunnaturally, missing him to the side. As R pulled her knife back, her stance\ncompromised, Q slid in close and made a feint before Sullivan could attack R.\n“Changing our knives’ trajectories?! How can you use such powerful magic?!”\n“Do you not understand? I am not the same person I used to be!”\n“Enough nonsense!”\nSwitching from a thrust to a slash, Q’s knife veered from its course for a\ndiagonal swipe.

This strength, it’s—”\n“Major!” Q shouted over Sullivan’s words.\nInstantly understanding what she meant, he pounced toward R, who was still\nregaining her balance.\nA blade fell from the sky.\nMidjump toward his adversary, he slid to the right, avoiding the short sword\nfalling from above. Barely hitting the ground, he rotated, and the short sword\nthat had been coming at Sullivan knocked away the knife aimed at Q and R.\nUsing the opening, Sullivan jumped at the wall of a building. Jumping off\nopposite walls three times, he reached the roof of one of the buildings that\nformed the alleyway.\nLooking up at him was a red-haired, golden-eyed masked magician attempting\nto chase him by the same route.\nBut as new psionic waves energized from the other side of the alley, she was\nforced to abandon her pursuit.\nNo—she knew she had to prevent any more victims, so she began to dash\ndeeper into the alley.\nThe sudden swelling of Leo’s fighting sense didn’t hasten him onward but\nrather stopped him in his tracks. What he’d said to Toshikazu about not doing\nanything dangerous hadn’t been an empty promise. He instinctively knew that\nwhat lay ahead was not a place he should tread out of simple curiosity.\nHe took a transmission unit out of his pocket and sent a short text to the\naddress Toshikazu had given him.\nThe vampire is here.\nLeo sent it with public location information turned on, so if the police chief\nnoticed it right away, he could apprehend the suspect. Deciding to withdraw\nbefore getting any more wrapped up in things, Leo turned on his heel—and\nnoticed a figure lying on a park bench.",
  "page_114": "His goodwill and caution struggled against each other. In the end, his\ndefensive instinct was the one to yield. It was less that he liked people and\nmore that he had little sense of fear. Had he inherited the weakness of his\nancestors, being born powerful? Still, without letting go of his caution, he\ncarefully stepped closer to the young woman lying limp on the bench.\n“Hey, are you all right?”\nHe gingerly reached out with a hand and gently shook her shoulder. The\nwoman gave no response, so he put a hand to her throat.\nLeo flinched backward. Her skin was cold, and she had no heartbeat—though,\nno. Actually, his fingers could feel a faint pulse.\nRattled, he took the transmission unit out. He made an emergency call—not\nto the police, but for an ambulance. As he was saying there was one person,\nand that she was about to die from bleeding out…\n…reflexively, he turned around and brought the device up in front of his face.\nThe transmission unit shattered.\nAfter he leaped back, his brain realized that the weapon had been an\nextendable police baton.\nAnd before his eyes, he found an odd opponent.\nUnderneath a round-brimmed hat was an eerie white mask with only the eyes\ncut out. A long coat reached down to the person’s ankles, perfectly concealing\nbody lines to the point that it blurred even their gender. However, their gender\nwasn’t the half of it—he couldn’t even tell if they were human.\nIn the back of his mind, the noise like buzzing bug wings began again. Just like\nbefore, he couldn’t understand it. But for some reason, this time, he felt as\nthough the “voice” was giving a warning for its comrades to withdraw.\nWhile Leo was preoccupied with the noise, the masked stranger closed the\ndistance in an instant. It was a self-acceleration spell, Leo realized, but he\ncouldn’t see any signs of an activation sequence expanding. They came so fast it\nwas like they’d built a magic program directly. Caught off guard and with no\ntime to use a hardening spell, Leo took the sideways baton hit on his left arm.",
  "page_115": "A dull sound of something being crushed.\nAt the sight of the twisted police baton, a confused grunt made it out from\nbehind the mask.\n“Why, you! That hurt!”\nLeo’s uppercut to the body caught the stranger in the chest. A hard sound\nrang out.\nHis opponent staggered heavily backward, and Leo shook his arms out as\nthough they stung. But none of his bones seemed broken. Even his left arm,\nwhich had received the duralumin baton directly, was moving without difficulty.\n“Carbon armor under your coat? What do you need all that for?”\nShould’ve brought a weapon, he thought with bitter resentment, keeping his\neyes fixed on the masked stranger and taking up a stance. No doubt about it,\nthis had to be one of the vampires.\nThe stranger tossed their baton aside and stuck both hands forward. They\ntook up a low-profile position with the left side jutting forward, with their left\nfist at jaw height and right fist in front of their solar plexus. Leo thought it\nlooked like a Chinese kenpo stance. And he noticed one other thing, too: The\nfists were small, almost like a woman’s— With a gust of wind, the stranger\nattacked—self-acceleration plus assistance from a tailwind, generated out of a\nfluid-motion spell.\nA thin, razor-like blade came flying at him with the wind; it bounced off Leo’s\nalready magically hardened jacket.\nHe intercepted the stranger’s downward hand chop with his left arm.\nThe stranger grabbed it.\nIn the same instant, a sudden sense of exhaustion washed over Leo. Because\nof that, his right fist stopped.\nThe stranger’s right hand reached for a spot on his chest above his heart.\nLeo gave a burst of spirit and forced his right punch to follow through.\nThe moment the stranger’s right hand reached Leo’s chest, Leo’s fist plunged",

But he also knew it wasn’t a decisive blow.\nLetting go of his consciousness now meant accepting defeat. With no proof\nwhatsoever that it wouldn’t mean an end to his life, too, he drove himself to\nlook up.",
  "page_118": "The stranger was already standing erect. They were clutching their chest, but\nas Leo had thought, the injury didn’t seem to have taken any of his opponent’s\ncombat power away. Still, for some reason, the stranger didn’t move to follow\nup their attack. They weren’t even looking at Leo.\nHe followed the stranger’s gaze, hidden by the mask, and saw that there was\nan oni standing there.\nRed hair, golden eyes. It looked small, either because of the distance or\nbecause his mind was hazy.\nThrough his murky awareness, he thought he saw the stranger beginning to\nflee through the now-sideways night streets, and the oni chasing after them.\nLina, who had become the masked magician Sirius, locked eyes with Leo, who\nlay sprawled on the road, for a moment, herself seemingly at a loss. But her\nhesitation only lasted an instant; Angie Sirius decided to pursue the stranger.\nBecause she’d prioritized saving the hunters earlier, the stranger wearing the\nbat mask—Deimos Second, aka Charles Sullivan—had already gotten away. She\ncouldn’t let this white-masked stranger flee as well.\n“Silvie, have you identified their psionic wave pattern?” asked Lina. Silvia was\nin their mobile base.\nBut the answer she gave wasn’t a favorable one. “I’m terribly sorry. There’s\ntoo much noise for me to pinpoint it.”\n“What about the cameras?” Hearing their psion radar wouldn’t do her any\ngood; maybe she could chase them using low-altitude satellite cameras…?\n“I have them for the moment. But this is a city, with plenty of obstacles, so I\ndon’t know how long I’ll be able to trace them.”\n“Understood. I’ll continue my pursuit.”\nRealizing she couldn’t rely on any technical support, she quickened her pace.\nDespite how late it was, the roads were filled with young people. The stranger\nblended in with them, quickly thinning their trail of psions. Lina turned up the\ngear on her self-acceleration spell so she wouldn’t lose sight of the stranger’s\nback as they ran at an inhuman speed.",
  "page_119": "As though noticing she’d closed the distance, White Mask suddenly changed\ncourse.\nOut of the busy streets and up a hill toward a residential area. The greenery\nincreased, while human presence decreased.\nFor Lina, that was advantageous. With fewer people, it would be easier to tell\nthe stranger’s psions apart. She chased after White Mask as they veered left\nand right on their path, using the person’s residual psions as a guide. Angie lost\nsight of their back more frequently now, but her extrasensory perception of\npsionic patterns was now far stronger. Her experience told her she was almost\nthere. And when she finally caught up, in a park— She was covered by psionic\nnoise.\nCast Jamming?!\nLina erased the thought from her mind. Her self-acceleration spell effects\nwere still all there. Although it was hard for Cast Jamming to affect a spell a\nperson applied to themselves, it was only relatively hard—not completely\nimpossible. And even given Lina’s—or rather, Sirius’s—magic abilities, Cast\nJamming’s effects couldn’t completely block her spell. That meant this noise\nhad to be something else.\nShoot!\nShe immediately knew what it was. Or rather, she was told.\nShe’d lost track of the residual psions from White Mask, whom she’d been\nchasing. But they hadn’t disappeared—she could no longer tell them apart.\nNow she finally understood why this person had led her somewhere with\nfewer people. If it got easier for her to tell her enemy’s psionic wave patterns\napart from others’, her enemy would also have an easier time telling her\npatterns apart. This noise was a type of long-distance magic; in order to\npinpoint Lina and create this noise, this White Mask person had brought her to\nan empty park in the middle of a residential area where everyone was asleep.\n…It pains me to admit it, but I can’t do this alone.\n“Major, what’s happening?!”",
  "page_120": "Worried about Lina’s sudden halt, Silvia, her voice slightly panicked, came\nover the radio.\n“I lost them. I’m returning to our mobile base,” she said, frustrated but\nsuccinct about her failure.\nErika Chiba’s morning started early. Her daily routine was to work up a good\nsweat from training before the sun rose.\nUntil the age of ten, she’d done it because her father had told her to.\nUntil she was fourteen and learned who she really was, she’d done it because\nshe wanted to be a greater swordswoman than the rest of the Chiba.\nUntil last March, she’d done it out of pure force of habit.\nBut ever since last April, ever since she’d met him, she’d done it because she\nwanted to, of her own volition. Because she wanted to grow stronger.\nShe didn’t hold a sword for morning training. Her father, who had his eye on\nErika’s aptitude, had raised her so that she could use the secret sword\ntechnique Mountain Tsunami—or rather, he’d raised her solely for that\npurpose. Her skill was a speed technique, fast as lightning, which changed into a\ngale that slashed and a thunderbolt that severed. And as part of training for\nthat, she was assigned to strengthen her leg muscles. Because of that, long\ntraining runs were treated as especially important.\nShe’d lost sight of her goal during those days of momentum and had been on\nthe verge of neglecting her footwork on the road. But ever since she’d decided\nfor herself to grow stronger, as long as she was at home, she never missed a\nsingle day of it.\nThis morning was no different as Erika rose from her bed when her alarm\nclock went off. Constitutionally, Erika wasn’t very strong in the morning. Her\nbody would react, but her mind wouldn’t wake up. Still, this bodily habit had\nbeen engraved into her by thousands of repetitions, and it slowly brought her\nfeet out of bed.\nStifling a yawn, with only her gait unsteady, she headed for the bathroom\nattached to her room. It was no more than a room with a shower and a vanity",
  "page_121": "unit, but still she had the whole room and its fixtures to herself. Such was the\nluxury of being the daughter of a wealthy family.\nThe current Chiba head was, at the very least, not a miser who would\ndiscriminate among his children in terms of who got what physical\naccommodation.\nDespite it being the middle of winter, she didn’t turn on the hot water; she\nonly fully woke up after washing her face with the freezing cold. Erika had just\ngone over to her closet to change into her workout clothes when she saw the\n“incoming text message” light on her phone blinking out of the corner of her\neye.\nThe sun still hadn’t risen; in precise time, it was 5:30 AM. She’d gone to sleep\nat 11:00 PM last night, and she didn’t have any unread messages left, so this one\nmust have come in the middle of the night. Then, a growing premonition\ncaused her to go over and look at it rather than leave it for later.\nDue to its simplicity, the text message was still used in this day and age. And\nwhen Erika saw this one, she scowled. After reading it over, she began to\nmutter, a creaking, gnashing sound coming from her teeth as she did.\n“My brother is such an idiot… What is he making that idiot do…?”\nShe tore off her pajamas and changed her underwear.\nThen, from her closet, rather than her workout gear, she took out a sweater\nand a skirt.\nThe bad news reached Tatsuya just before he left the house to go to school.\nIt was a plaintext message sent to his portable device, not a call on his house\nphone. Normally, the text format was only used for disaster forecast delivery,\ngiving this particular one an ominously urgent impression. Of course, such a\nvaguely urgent message would, once read, be overwritten and then disappear\nlike all the others.\nThe sender was Erika.\n“Brother, is it poor news?”\nMiyuki, keenly picking up on the shift in her brother’s emotions, looked up at",

Even\nsomething happening in an adjacent town would be extensively reported—you\ncould also call it exaggeration—which made you think it an event from a\nfictional world with no relation to you. To say nothing of this crazy vampire\ncrime incident. It was, perhaps, no wonder they didn’t feel a sense of reality\nfrom it. However…\n“It’s true.”\nHowever crazy it might have seemed, averting his eyes from the truth would\nhave brought naught but a disadvantage. Only by confronting a threat head-on\ncould they come up with plans to counteract it.\n“He’s receiving treatment at the police hospital in Nakano. Thankfully, his life\nisn’t in danger, so we can wait to visit him until after school.”\n“…Yes, Brother.”\nFor Miyuki, Leonhard Saijou was no more than a friend through her brother. If\nTatsuya said it was okay to do it after school, then she had no reason to argue—\nno matter what she thought deep down.\nErika didn’t go to school that day.\nShe’d contacted Tatsuya, Mizuki, Mikihiko, and the school office about it, so\neveryone would have known.\nHowever, what nobody would have known was that Leo’s hospital room—\nwhich Erika was monitoring under the pretense of looking after him (from the\nperch of a hallway bench)—also had upperclassmen inside, visiting.\nAttendance was no longer mandatory for seniors, so the time wasn’t an issue.\nBut she couldn’t have predicted that students who weren’t related to the club",

After all,\nErika wasn’t nursing him; she was just keeping an eye on him—more precisely,\nshe was keeping watch for any uninvited guests who might come to visit. So she\nhad no reason to stop them.\nShe stood up, and without a word to the two seniors, passed them by and\nwalked away.\nErika was headed for one of the hospital offices. Her brother and his right-\nhand man were there.\nErika entered without knocking, and Toshikazu awkwardly dropped his gaze.\nHis cheeks were a little swollen and red, though it was mostly gone at this\npoint. It only made Erika regret not punching him harder. She found herself\nthinking that she should have gone for the full-frontal, hip-action slap, not just a\nregular, if vigorous, backhand.\nAfter all, she almost never got the chance to whack this “idiot brother” of hers\nwithout resistance.\nShe should never have let even the tiniest chance of unhindered honesty\nescape her, if it could lighten the resentment toward him that had been piling\nup since she was little.\n“…Umm, young lady? You wouldn’t happen to be thinking anything\ndangerous, would you?”\nErika, her darkly unhappy thoughts interrupted, turned a stinging glare on\nInagaki.\nHe winced, eyes wandering under her gaze.",
  "page_124": "Erika’s father treated her coldly, but she had many sympathizers among their\nstudents. She had a bright personality and a coquettish prettiness, and above\nall, was the only one who could use the secret sword technique Mountain\nTsunami. She had mastered it in real combat; she held what was basically an\nidol position in the Chiba school, and it wasn’t for her bloodline—as she was the\ndaughter of the family head—but instead, for her sword skills and personal\ncharm.\nUnder her glare, many a student of their dojo would probably have to deal\nwith several uncomfortable feelings.\nAnd besides, Inagaki couldn’t oppose Erika with his level of skill. If he was ever\nassigned to be her practice partner, she would readily push him around. In\naddition to her original talent, her skills had skyrocketed in the last half year. It\nwas said the only swordsmen in the Chiba dojo who could rival her anymore\nwere the family head and her two older brothers. For all intents and purposes,\nshe had reached full mastery of her art; and the students whispered openly that\nthe only reason she hadn’t been certified was out of consideration for her older\nsister, who only had average skill and talent when it came to swords.\n“Toshikazu.”\nThe man reluctantly looked at her. She spoke the word with a masculine\nbrusqueness, which perfectly matched her attitude, not bothering to conceal\nher irritation.\n“The Saegusa’s and Juumonji’s direct descendants just went to visit him.” You\nknow what they’re here for, don’t you? she asked with only her threatening\ngaze.\nInagaki stiffened further at Erika’s relentless stare, but Toshikazu, as\nexpected, didn’t seem to want to be apologetic with his sister anymore.\n“The girl rescued along with Saijou last night was apparently a member of the\nSaegusa.”\n“That’s all?”\n“And a warning from our superiors not to probe any further.”\nToshikazu shrugged, lifting his hands toward the ceiling with an exaggerated",

She clicked her tongue. “Kasumigaseki is\none thing, but isn’t Sakuradamon our turf?”\n“Well, we’re assigned to Kasumigaseki.”\n“Useless,” muttered Erika bitterly. But she had enough reason left not to vent\nher frustration any more. “The bugs?”\n“All broke when they entered the room. I hadn’t expected the Fairy Princess’s\nMultiscope to be so efficient.”\nFairy Princess was a derivative of Mayumi’s nickname Elfin Sniper, a\npseudonym used mainly by magical athletes in ranged sports. Fairy implied\nsmall, which fit Mayumi to a tee, but that meant nobody used it to her face.\n“Still useless… What about the one we planted outside the room?”\n“That one was disabled by sound-blocking. Juumonji’s barrier magic,”\nanswered Inagaki in a businesslike tone.\nErika couldn’t even muster a useless this time. “Then just a guess. I’m sure\nyou have a guess, right?”\nToshikazu shrugged again under Erika’s glare. “Really just a guess, though. It\nseems like the Saegusa are hiding victims.”\n“…You mean they’re hiding corpses?” His “guess” was shadier than she’d\nexpected, and she couldn’t conceal her surprise.\nConcealment of corpses was a method of destroying evidence. Though it\nmeant something different from directly disposing of a corpse you’d killed\nyourself, it nonetheless couldn’t be called wholly legal. Even though the Ten\nMaster Clans had supralegal rights, they would never get in the police’s way\nwith grave criminal acts of mass murder…\nThat was when Erika realized the underlying meaning. “Which means this\nvampire incident is related to magicians, right?”\n“Probably. We don’t know whether they’re victims or perpetrators, though.”\n“Victims? I can understand dealing with things in secret on their own without",

After asking for his room at the reception desk, they headed for the\nelevator. But shortly before they arrived there, his name was called out from\nthe side.\n“You all came!”\n“You’re still here, Erika?”\nHe knew the basic situation from her text message this morning: Erika’s eldest\nbrother was in charge of the vampire incident, and Leo had been cooperating\nwith him when he’d been embroiled in it. Erika, to make him take responsibility,\nhad taken the day off school and gone to the hospital they’d brought Leo to.\nBut that message had come before they’d gone to school, and now it was\nevening and the sun was about to set. The expression still in regard to her\npresence was more than appropriate.\n“It’s not like I was here the whole time. I went back home and got back about\nan hour ago, since I figured you’d all come,” Erika explained as the group filed\ninto the elevator.\nHe sensed nothing of a lie in her tone or face.\nIt was just so natural that it came off as suspicious, and Erika was probably\nthe only one who didn’t notice that.\n“Erika, is Leo okay…?” Mizuki whispered as she stood next to Erika in the\nelevator. She’d see for herself soon enough, but she was still uneasy. Depending\non the person, such emotions easily outstripped logic.\n“He’s fine, Mizuki. I told you in the text message, remember? His life isn’t in\ndanger.”",
  "page_127": "The steadfast attitude was something that didn’t suit everyone. As Mizuki\nbreathed a sigh of relief, Erika looked down at her with warm eyes, but if an\nuntidy man had done the same, he doubtless would have been treated coldly.\nMizuki appeared to not be the only one with such concerns, but the rest\ndidn’t say it. With the air around them stiffened quite a bit, Erika knocked on\nthe hospital room door.\n“Please come in.” A young woman’s voice came from inside.\n“Thanks, Kaya.”\nPaying no mind to the obvious confusion on her friends’ faces, Erika opened\nthe door and shuffled them into the room.\nThe fastest to collect himself in situations like this was, as always, Tatsuya.\nBefore Erika disappeared behind the curtain hung at the entrance, he\nproceeded into the hospital room. Miyuki followed him not a hair behind, and\nHonoka, seeing that, trotted to catch up with them; Mizuki and Mikihiko traded\nglances before stepping inside and closing the door behind them.\nWaiting for them in the rather wide—in other words, quite high-grade—\nprivate room was Leo, sitting up in bed with boredom plastered on his face, and\na young woman with ash-blonde hair sitting on a folding chair spread out next\nto him.\nShe was probably four or five years older than them. Her hair, which\nresembled the Einebrise proprietor’s, gave the same ethnic impression. And her\nfeatures, if deepened a little and gender-swapped, would be just like Leo’s—it\nmade their blood relation easy to imagine.\n“This is Kaya Saijou, Leo’s older sister.”\nBefore anyone could put the question into words, Erika introduced the\nwoman. Her identity was as Tatsuya and the others had expected.\nKaya rose and bowed politely in their direction. Her bow couldn’t be called\nelegant or polished, but it was still a clear departure in terms of politeness from\nstudents.\n“She seems like a nice sister,” Mizuki murmured to herself after Kaya",
  "page_128": "disappeared behind them out the door, watching her go. It was an honest\nstatement.\nTatsuya felt the same, and no objections rose to the others’ faces, either.\nLeo, though, winced slightly at this assessment.\n“You sure got hit hard.” Tatsuya, noticing this, didn’t delve any further. Leo’s\nfamily matters were no business of his to begin with.\n“Yeah, this sure doesn’t look good for me,” said Leo with an embarrassed\ngrin. The pained look from before was gone without a trace.\n“You don’t appear to be wounded, though.”\n“As if they’d get me that easy! It wasn’t like I was helpless.”\n“Then where did you get hurt?” Tatsuya asked the natural question of Leo as\nhe grinned fearlessly.\nLeo’s smile disappeared in an instant. “Not really sure…”\nBut that didn’t mean he was down in the dumps. He was tilting his head, his\nexpression not frustrated at his defeat, but truly baffled by it.\n“During the brawl, my body suddenly lost its energy. I used the last of what I\nhad to get in one good hit so I could run away, but then I couldn’t stand up\nanymore, either. While I was lying on the road, Erika’s brother, the police chief,\nfound me.”\n“And it wasn’t poison, right?”\n“Yeah. They checked everywhere, but there were no cuts or stab wounds, and\neven a blood test came up clean.”\nIt was indeed a strange story. As Tatsuya mimicked Leo’s gesture to tilt his\nhead in wonder, Mikihiko got a word in.\n“Did you see who they were?”\n“Well, I mean, I saw them. Hat pulled low over the eyes, a totally white mask,\na long coat with hardened body armor underneath. I couldn’t make out any\nlooks or features. But…”\n“But?”",
  "page_129": "“I can’t shake the feeling it was a woman.”\n“…A woman was fighting evenly with you with physical strength?” said\nMikihiko, eyes widening.\n“It’s not like that’s impossible or anything,” argued Erika. “Give a grade\nschooler a drug and even she could strangle an adult man to death.”\n“You’re right, but…”\n“But?”\n“It’s possible she was never a normal person to begin with,” muttered\nMikihiko in a low voice.\nErika’s eyes went wide. “Huh?! Miki… You can’t possibly believe there’s\nactually a vampire around, can you?”\n“My name is Mikihiko,” he complained sullenly. But nobody could blame her\nfor reacting like that—even among magicians, very few actually believed in the\nexistence of mythical monsters like vampires, even if they did enjoy the gossip.\n“Do you have some idea?”\nBut the response Tatsuya showed didn’t belong to either the majority or that\nrare group. He didn’t believe in youkai, but he also didn’t reject the idea that\ntheir spawning point could be something other than a normal human.\nAt his attempt to draw Mikihiko out, the latter answered hesitantly, though\nwith a hint of confidence. “I think what Leo encountered was a parasite.”\n“A parasite? You don’t mean in the traditional sense, right?” asked Erika,\ntilting her head, this time asking seriously—and with visible curiosity on her\nface.\nThat apparently brought his mood back around, because Mikihiko began with\na professorial air, “A paranormal parasite technically, but just a parasite for\nshort. Once the existence and power of magic became clear, international\ncooperation didn’t only happen over modern magic. Old magic wasn’t allowed\nto stay sequestered in its shell; internationalization was unavoidable.\nInternational conferences held by those speaking about old magic were held\nseveral times, mainly in the United Kingdom, and during those, they designed a",
  "page_130": "common and precise terminology and set of ideas.”\n“We know that international cooperation served to make old magic flourish.\nWhat about it?” Tatsuya interjected, throwing a damper on the geek parade.\nMikihiko cleared his throat and regrouped. “Parasite is one of the terms they\ndefined. People from different countries had different names and connotations\nfor them, like specters, evil spirits, jinn, demons, but parasite is now what they\ncall anything with magical properties that can feed off a human and remake\nthem into something else. Internationalism might have come, but old magic’s\nfocus on secrecy didn’t change, so I’d think it would be only natural for most\nmodern magicians not to know about it.”\n“So specters and evil spirits really do exist…” whispered Honoka under her\nbreath.\nTatsuya placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. “Nobody thought magic\nexisted, either. But now we know it does. Just because we don’t know what\nsomething is doesn’t mean we need to be afraid of it.”\nTatsuya hadn’t acted like this spontaneously—he was aware that his presence\nheld major sway with her. So when he saw her body twitch at the sensation of\nhis hand and her blind unease wiped away, he withdrew—even though he had\nto pretend he didn’t see how reluctant she was for them to part.\n“Is that the identity of our vampire?” he asked, turning to Mikihiko. Being\nscared was a disadvantage, but ignorance was a worse threat.\nWithout answering his question directly, Mikihiko, seeming to have resolved\nhimself to action, turned back to face Leo. “Leo?”\n“Y-yeah?”\nAction enough that his glowing enthusiasm overwhelmed his classmate.\n“Would you mind it if I took a look at your ethereal body?”\n“My ethereal body?”\nThe term didn’t seem to make sense to Leo, and he parroted the syllables\nright back. To an extent, nobody could blame him. Spirit form was one thing,\nbut ethereal body wasn’t a term very often used in modern magic.",
  "page_131": "“Your ethereal body is an information body shaped the same as your physical\nbody, created from spirit matter. It connects your mind and body,” Mikihiko\nexplained simply. “Your ethereal body is a bundle of spirit energy—in other\nwords, life force. It’s thought that monsters that feed on human flesh and blood\ntake in a person’s spirit energy through their blood or flesh to fuel themselves.”\n“In other words, vampires drink blood, but what they’re really sucking is the\nspirit energy they get from it?” asked Erika.\nMikihiko nodded, expression tense. “Vampires suck blood, and man-eaters\neat flesh. But since neither of them are physical creatures to begin with, they\nshould only need to absorb spirit energy. If the teachings passed down by us old\ncasters are true.”\n“Going by that idea, it wouldn’t be strange for there to be a vampire who only\nsucks out spirit energy,” said Tatsuya quietly.\nMikihiko nodded again. “If I take a look at Leo’s ethereal form, I think I’ll know\nfor sure… To tell the truth, from the start, I never thought this vampire incident\nwas done by just a strange person, or that they were simple bizarre crimes. Not\nonly because there was no sign of blood being drawn—my intuition as an old\ncaster was telling me so, but I didn’t have any proof until now. It was just my\ngut talking, so I didn’t tell anyone about parasites. But that means it’s my fault\nLeo was attacked, and—”\n“Don’t worry about it, Mikihiko.”\nAs Mikihiko started to blame himself, Leo cut him off. It took a moment for\nthe words to sink in. “…Really?”\n“Yeah. Actually, I want you to do this. No way to cure me if we don’t know the\ncause, right?”\nLeo’s words held two layers of forgiveness. Mikihiko, meaning to respond to\nhis trust, drew his face back farther, then reached for the bag he’d placed at his\nfeet.\nUsing an amulet, ink and paper, and other traditional spell tools that even\nTatsuya was seeing for the first time, Mikihiko completed his check of Leo’s\nstatus. And Mikihiko didn’t bother trying to hide his surprise. The idea probably",
  "page_132": "didn’t even occur to him.\n“What to say… I thought Tatsuya was pretty amazing, but Leo, are you really\nhuman…?”\n“Hey, now. That’s not very nice to say.”\nA joke would have been one thing, but Mikihiko’s murmur was serious, and\neven Leo couldn’t seem to laugh it off. He was clearly offended. But Mikihiko\nwas so surprised he didn’t care—or, rather, he didn’t even notice. “Well, I\nmean…I can’t believe you’re up. With this much of your spirit energy eaten, a\nnormal caster would have fallen unconscious and stayed that way.”\n“Leaving aside what exactly spirit energy is, you can even tell how much he’s\nmissing?” asked Tatsuya, evidently impressed.\nMikihiko nodded, not entirely subdued. “Your ethereal body takes the same\nshape as your physical body. The container can only be so large, so I can make a\nrough guess as to how much spirit energy there was to begin with, and how\nmuch is gone.”\nHe narrowed his eyes and gave Leo another suspicious stare. “Right now, Leo\nhas so little spirit energy left that a normal person wouldn’t be able to sit up—in\nfact, they wouldn’t even be conscious. The fact that he’s sitting up and talking\nto us means his body has some high stats on it.”\nFor Mikihiko, those words came casually.\nThe expression high stats, however, bored a hole in Leo’s heart; he’d\ninherited genes that had undergone modification to raise his capabilities. “Well,\nmy body’s special order.”\nNevertheless, Leo gave a grin. He knew his classmate didn’t mean anything by\nit, and anyway, ugly displays of venting went against his code.\n“Anyway, the reason my strength drained was because the masked woman\nate my spirit energy or whatever, right?” he asked, quashing his mental tumult.\n“I think so. But…”\n“But?”\n“…If she could absorb your spirit energy just by touching you in the middle of",
  "page_133": "a fight, she shouldn’t need to take your blood. I don’t know how she takes\npeople’s blood without leaving a trace, but…why would this parasite be going\nthrough the needless trouble of taking it in the first place?”\nTatsuya didn’t possess that answer. The truth was that the blood hadn’t been\nstolen, it had only been lost, so at the present time, he had no way of arriving at\nthe correct explanation.\nVisiting hours ended, and the visiting five—Tatsuya, Miyuki, Mikihiko,\nHonoka, and Mizuki—left the hospital room behind them.\nErika had said she had something to talk to her brother Toshikazu about, so\nshe had stayed behind. Nobody took those words at face value, but nobody felt\nlike pointing that out, either.\n“Oh, right—Mikihiko.”\n“Yes?”\nHis name suddenly called, Mikihiko, who had been chatting with Mizuki,\nturned to look at Tatsuya dubiously.\nMiyuki and Honoka were to either side of Tatsuya.\nThey didn’t have their arms linked, but they weren’t much farther away than\nthat.\nIt wasn’t clear whether or not Mikihiko thought, at that moment, that popular\nguys could all go jump off a cliff.\nWhatever he thought, though, Tatsuya probably wouldn’t care, either.\n“There’s something I forgot to ask before,” said popular young man remarked.\nMore accurately, he’d purposely not asked it since there could have been\nlistening devices in the room, but it would have been hard for anyone, not just\nMikihiko, to glean that dangerous ulterior motive from his tone of voice.\n“What is it?”\n“All this talk about specters and evil spirits and parasites—do they appear\nthat frequently?”\nThough he wasn’t eating or drinking anything, Mikihiko almost choked.",
  "page_134": "Tatsuya’s tone was a casual one, so he’d listened just as casually, but it ended\nup being an outrageously profound question.\n“…Well, it’s not that rare for them to show up. Old stories always write about\nthem hiding somewhere and doing bad things, but most of them are the work\nof human mages pretending to be devils. We have an accepted opinion that the\nfamous Shuten-douji from Mount Ooe, for example, was actually a shaman who\ndrifted in from the western regions.”\nIt might not have been a conscious act, but Mikihiko put a hand to his chin,\nstriking up an obvious “thinking” pose.\n“As for the odds that a mage would meet a real demon… In a single school,\nwe’re talking about one person every ten generations. And even then, in most\ncases, they only find one that wandered into this world by coincidence. A real\ndemon causing harm to people and needing a mage to exterminate it is an\nemergency that only happens maybe once in a hundred years, through the\nentire world. The last recorded extermination of a real demon in Japan was nine\nhundred years ago when Abe-no-Yasunari exterminated a fox spirit.”\n“But this vampire incident is the work of a real demon?”\n“That’s what I think.”\n“Do you think it’s a coincidence?”\n“I can’t say the chances of it being a coincidence are zero, but…” Mikihiko’s\nanswer was extremely careful. “There is no doubt that recorded observations of\ndemons decrease the closer you get to modern times. I don’t think this incident\nhappened without any cause.”\nTatsuya’s reply was a simply murmured “I see.”\nAfter Tatsuya and the others went home and he saw Kaya return in their\nplace, Leo collapsed onto the bed as though his strength had run out. Erika was\nstill in the room, but he couldn’t be stubborn about it anymore.\n“…Well, I know the truth,” said Erika. “Why try to act tough? You did really\nwell.”\n“…I’ll take…that…as a compliment?”",
  "page_135": "“That’s what it was.” Erika gave a gentle smile as Leo closed his eyes painfully.\n“Umm, Erika… Will my brother really be all right?”\nBut Kaya, who was watching their exchange, certainly didn’t seem in the\nmood for smiling. It was natural, since she was a family member.\nErika, though, replied in a truly curt voice. “He’ll be fine. We have the finest\ndoctor the Chiba family knows treating him. This may be rather difficult to\nunderstand for someone who isn’t a magician, but when your energy dries up, it\ntakes more time to recover that than your physical strength. All the treatment\nhe needed is done with. He’ll get better given time and a specific medicine.”\nErika noticed Kaya shiver a little when she said “someone who isn’t a\nmagician,” but no comforting words came from her mouth.\n“I have to be getting back to my brother. If you need more for something,\nplease don’t hesitate to ask anyone—a nurse, my brother’s subordinate, or\nme.”\nWith an insincere bow, Erika left the hospital room.\nLeo didn’t bother trying to complain about her attitude.\n“Maybe you should let up a little, young lady,” said Inagaki to Erika as soon as\nshe entered the room they were using to listen in on Leo’s. He left out the part\nabout what she was supposed to be letting up, but Erika knew what he meant.\nAnd, knowing what he meant, she snorted, brushing off his sentiments. “I’m\nnot about to tell anyone to start liking magicians. Parent or brother, whatever—\nwhat’s scary is scary. Which means I’ll just keep that in mind when talking to\nher. Anyway… You’ve heard this all before, right?”\nThe last sentence was directed at Toshikazu. Her eldest brother, leaning back\nheavily on a chair, arms folded behind his neck to hold his head up, tore the\nheadphones from his ears in one rough movement and sat up.\n“That was a pretty interesting talk,” he said. “If the Yoshida’s second son’s\nreasoning is correct, what will you do, Erika?”\n“In this case, it doesn’t matter if he’s right or not,” she replied, her eyes\nscornful, as though he’d asked something stupid. She looked down at her",
  "page_136": "brother, still sitting in the chair. “Even if it was only temporary, he passed\nthrough our gates as a Chiba student. I was even the one personally initiating\nhim, so you could call him my first pupil. How could I sit back and watch after\nsomething like this happened to my pupil?”\n“Such a cold reason.”\n“It doesn’t need to be anything else. That’s more than enough for me to grind\nwhoever did this to dust. I don’t care if this vampire is a man or a woman—\nthey’re the one who came looking for a fight. All I need to do is accept it.”\nEven Toshikazu, her older brother, couldn’t tell whether that was her real\nreason or if she was hiding embarrassment.\nBut he did know one thing for sure: She was entirely serious about this.\nWhile Tatsuya and the others were visiting Leo, Lina was visiting Maximillian\nDevices’ Tokyo branch offices. This was where her neighbor Mikaela Hongou,\naka Mia Hongou, was working, and one of the secret bases for their fugitive\npursuit team.\nA magic high school student coming to tour a CAD manufacturer wasn’t an\nunusual thing, though not as common as a university-level student. Passing\nthrough reception with a letter of introduction prepared by the embassy and on\nthe strength of her First High uniform, Lina came face-to-face in one of their\nconference rooms with the Stardust member she’d barely saved last night, as\nwell as a woman in a tight skirt suit.\n“Major, thank you for your timely assistance last night.”\n“Please, be at ease.”\nGesturing for the two women who met her with a salute to take a seat, Lina\nsat down on the sofa herself. When she closed her eyes and let out a big breath,\nthe now redheaded girl opened her golden eyes.\nDifferent colors, a different face from Angelina Kudou Shields.\nBut there was no look of surprise on the two Stardust faces. This girl, with the\ngolden eyes and cold features, was Major Sirius to them.",
  "page_137": "“What did the damage look like from last night?”\n“We underwent maintenance, ma’am. It won’t affect the mission.”\nLina—no, Angie Sirius—frowned at how the hunter spoke of herself like a\ntool, but doing that in this form only served to increase her cold impression; it\ndidn’t look like she was displeased.\n“I see. I’ll hear your report, then.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\nLina felt that her order lacked enough words to mean anything, but the\nhunter seemed to understand it. “After finding Deimos Second, we used a Cast\nJammer in accordance with the data we were given beforehand,” the hunter\nsaid. “However, the Cast Jammer was ineffectual against him.”\n“Did he interfere with the Cast Jammer’s operation?”\n“No, ma’am. The Cast Jammer was functioning properly. According to what\nDeimos Second said personally, he no longer needs a CAD to cast.”\n“No need for a CAD… Are you saying Sergeant Sullivan became psychic?”\n“Affirmative, ma’am.”\nLina’s dubious question met with a clear yes.\n“Deimos Second did not, in fact, use a CAD, and only used vector reflection\nmagic.”\n“You mean he didn’t use any other spells?”\n“Affirmative, ma’am.”\n“In addition, Deimos Second’s physical abilities outstripped our enhanced\nones.”\nThe increase in the fugitive’s physical abilities was new information. After\nthinking for a moment, Lina asked the two hunters again, just to make sure.\n“Sergeant Sullivan’s psionic wave properties hadn’t changed, correct?”\n“At the very least, we were able to identify it as his, yes, ma’am.”\n“While pursuing Sergeant Sullivan, I made contact with someone who",
  "page_138": "appeared to be his comrade. Were you able to observe their psi-wave\nproperties?”\n“…I’m terribly sorry, ma’am. Apart from the major’s and Deimos’s psi-waves,\nwe couldn’t perceive anything.”\n“I see…” Lina closed her eyes again and stayed silent for a short time. “…It\nlooks like we can’t rely on past data. The next time you find the deserter, hold\noff on your pursuit and don’t engage him directly. I’ll deal with him personally.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\nAs the two Stardust members stood and saluted, Lina returned it, then left\nthe conference room behind her.\nSilvia was waiting for Lina in a hallway in the Maximillian Devices Tokyo\nbranch office.\n“This way, Commander.”\nLina, with her red hair and golden eyes, nodded and followed after Silvia. She\nwas brought to a women’s changing room for employees.\n“Please enter, Major. I’ve confirmed that nobody else is inside.”\nAs Silvia unlocked the door and entered, Lina followed, giving a quick glance\naround before slipping into the changing room. At the sound of the lock from\ninside, Lina breathed a sigh of relief.\nHer hair and eye color had changed.\nHer red hair became golden, and her golden eyes turned a clear sky blue.\n“This form is so much easier. It’s tough to hide the fact that I’m using magic to\nchange my appearance.”\n“Major, we don’t have much time. Please change clothes before any\nemployees come.”\nLina seemed to be too relaxed, so her subordinate immediately scolded her.\nLina winced. As she removed her garments, she said, “It looks like the chasers\ncouldn’t identify White Mask’s psi-waves, either.”\n“I see… It looks like the abilities the fugitives gained vary pretty widely.”",
  "page_139": "As though she had been expecting Lina to say something, there was no\nsurprise in Silvia’s voice. Only a disappointed air drifted from her shoulders.\n“I wonder why they were attacking Japanese people,” said Lina, now in her\nunderwear, reaching for her First High uniform.\n“Why, ma’am?” repeated Silvia dubiously, not understanding the point of her\nremark.\n“They’re on the run. Shouldn’t they want to hide what they are from us?”\n“Ah, I see.”\nWith that, Silvia figured out what Lina found strange. She was asking why the\ndeserter would brave the risk of being caught in order to attack Japanese\npeople.\n“I don’t know that, but…”\n“But what?” prompted Lina, changing her stockings for leggings and buttoning\nup the front of her one-piece.\n“But I get the feeling the strange ability he gained has something to do with\nit.”\n“The strange ability… You mean the vampire one, taking blood without\nleaving a wound?” Lina asked, putting on her blazer and inner gown and tying\nher hair back.\n“Well, I don’t know if we should be calling him a vampire, but… Lina, what are\nyou doing?”\nSilvia, who had been looking elsewhere to get her thoughts in order, returned\nher gaze to her commander and saw the blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty\nholding the hem of her fluttering school gown up in front of a full-length mirror,\ntwisting and turning.\n“I, uh, this is…”\nAs her commander shot up straight and looked down red faced, Silvia heaved\na deep sigh.",

His feint, which\nhad left an afterimage, had been an unplanned, spur-of-the-moment move. He\nhadn’t predicted that his art from a moment before it would be broken.\n“Cocoon Water Mirage… That wasn’t one of your usual illusion arts, was it,\nMaster?”\n“You could tell that, too, eh?” Yakumo sighed, resigned, but didn’t fully hide\nthe amused curling at the edges of his mouth—though he probably never\nintended to. “That odd ability of yours to read a spell just by looking at it is the\ndefinition of a threat to your enemies.

I’m sure you’ll\nfigure it out quickly.”\nTatsuya wanted to say, Stop putting on airs, but he didn’t.

Why do you look so serious…? Well, that’s normal. But why the scary\nvoice?”",
  "page_143": "Whether calling his serious face normal was a compliment or an insult wasn’t\nquite clear, and Tatsuya couldn’t determine which it was. But he didn’t engage\nthe man—he decided not to react.\nYakumo gave him a dissatisfied look for some reason, so he probably\nunderstood. And Tatsuya wasn’t in the mood to go along with his “jokes.”\n“You referred to the eyes of ‘things not of this world.’”\n“Oh, I see.”\nHe didn’t need to finish his question. The immediate reply made it seem like\nYakumo had predicted what Tatsuya would ask.\n“Humans aren’t our only opponents. It’s not rare to fight things\nsupernatural.”\nThe answer was one Tatsuya had predicted from the context, but it also went\nagainst his background knowledge. “A friend of mine, an old-magic user, said\nthat encountering actual demons was an extremely rare thing…”\nIt wasn’t about whom he chose to believe; Tatsuya wanted an answer he\ncould satisfy himself with.\n“You must be referring to the second son of the Yoshida. Well, he’s not\nwrong, but…that’s a surprising lack of follow-up from you.”\nYakumo paused for a moment. Told to think about it harder, Tatsuya sank into\nthe sea of his own thoughts, and before long, arrived at an answer.\n“What Mikihiko said isn’t wrong. But that doesn’t mean it’s completely right,\neither. Is that what you mean? It might be rare to randomly encounter real\nspecters or goblins, but if it’s not a coincidence—if someone did it on purpose—\nit’s not rare?”\n“You just barely get passing marks for that.” As his words suggested,\nYakumo’s expression was far from satisfied. “Hmm… I guess it’s hard even for\nsomeone as knowledgeable as you to avoid the traps of symbolism and\npreconceptions.”\nHis remarks had gotten even worse. Tatsuya thought to himself that calling\nsomeone knowledgeable to their face was embarrassing (not that it would",
  "page_144": "make him blush), and he wished his teacher would stop. Still, Tatsuya’s reaction\nwas quite relaxed, since it wasn’t the time for compliments, even by accident.\nBut Yakumo’s next words blew Tatsuya’s relaxation out of the water.\n“You’ve had experience yourself contacting things not of this world once or\ntwice. What, exactly, do you think what you modern magicians call ‘SB magic’\nuses as a medium?”\nAn “Oh” made it out of Tatsuya’s mouth.\n“You get it now. Modern magicians call them spiritual beings—spirits, in other\nwords—and those certainly aren’t of this world.”\nTatsuya had indeed overlooked that. He stared at Yakumo as the man\ncontinued his explanation.\n“Yes, whether something is intelligent or not is secondary. Bacteria might not\nbe intelligent or sapient, but they get into our bodies, interfere with how they\nwork, and make us sick. Even viruses only have imperfect multiplication\nabilities. And even if, academically, they’re not classified as ‘creatures,’ nobody\nwould argue that they’re not living things that damage a person’s body.”\n“You’re saying there’s no doubt spiritual beings—these ‘spirits’ that are no\nmore than independent information bodies cut off from phenomena—are\nthings ‘not of this world’?”\n“To be precise, they might be better called ‘things without life or flesh.’ Also,\nhas anyone confirmed that spirits don’t have a mind?”\nIt took over a second for Tatsuya to answer this question. “…Nobody has. And\nI know someone who would say just the opposite.”\nAnd Tatsuya had experience being somewhere with that friend as he\nremotely controlled spiritual beings. The spirits had shown autonomy in\ncarrying out the commands given to them; rather than believing it was all built\ninto the algorithms in magic programs, it almost seemed more logical to believe\nthe spirits themselves had minds of their own.\n“Master, may I ask one more thing?”\n“Go ahead.”",
  "page_145": "“According to modern magic, spirits are independent information bodies\ncreated when information bodies described by the Idea along with natural\nphenomena disengage from physicality. And because they record the original\nphenomenon’s information, you can recreate that phenomenon from the\ninformation by defining a direction in a magic program. This is what we think of\nas spirit magic.”\n“I think that’s correct, for the most part. Making such logical connections is\nsomething modern magic is one or two levels better at.”\n“Then if parasites can feed off a person’s ethereal body and change the\nperson’s properties, what information bodies would they be based on?”\nAfter hearing what Mikihiko had said, Tatsuya had been thinking parasites\nmight be information bodies that interfered with a person’s structural\ninformation. It seemed like Yakumo was substantiating that by using bacteria\nand viruses for his examples.\n“Parasites, eh…? That’s a British expression. Unfortunately, I don’t know what\ninformation organisms they originate in. They interfere with people’s minds,\nthough, so I’d think they’re based in spirit phenomena.”\n“‘Information organisms’ originating in the mind…”\n“I believe that humanoid specters and animal youkai might be creatures from\nthis world that have been altered by wraiths, a type of information organism.\nAnd just as spirits originating in physical phenomena drift through a shadow\nworld back-to-back with this one, the wraiths originating in mental phenomena\nmight come from the shadow world back-to-back with our mental world. Our\nlack of encounters with them isn’t because they don’t exist, but because we\ndon’t yet have the proper technology to observe minds. It might be an\nanomalous idea from the perspective of those in London, but that’s my own\nunadulterated theory.”\nThe title of old-magic authority isn’t for nothing, thought Tatsuya, for the first\ntime in a while.\nFor the following two days, Leo was bedridden. He was in a severe enough\nstate that a normal person would have been unconscious, so it was only natural",
  "page_146": "he’d need more than three or four days before being discharged. It would have\nbeen more worrying if they did discharge him now, whether he forced them to\nor they gave up on him.\nAt least, that was how Tatsuya thought of it.\nOf course, there was someone who didn’t think that way.\n“I wonder if Leo is all right…”\nMizuki was the prime example of the type of person who didn’t think that\nway.\n“He’ll be fine,” said Tatsuya. “Aside from the bruises, he wasn’t really\nwounded, and Erika said none of his bones were broken or organs injured,\nright? You’re not thinking she lied, are you?”\nIncidentally, Tatsuya did indeed suspect that Erika, who wasn’t here at the\nmoment, had lied.\n“Well, no, but…”\nStill, with Mizuki’s personality, no matter what she really thought, she could\nnever call a friend a liar. Even though Erika wasn’t here—actually, precisely\nbecause she wasn’t here—Mizuki doubtless wanted to avoid talking behind her\nback.\nAlso, Erika wasn’t here—here being the classroom before school started—not\nbecause she was staying to look after Leo, but simply because she hadn’t\narrived at school yet. Yesterday, she’d come running in just in time; she’d\nprobably do the same today.\n“Come to think of it, Mikihiko isn’t here yet this morning, either.”\nHis remark didn’t have any particular connotation. He was thinking about\nErika not being there yet and then happened to notice Mikihiko wasn’t, either.\nBut that was all it took for Mizuki’s face to appear to draw back for a moment.\nTatsuya clamped down on the pleasant smile he felt coming up and wondered\nwhat to say to her—or whether to say anything at all. He was certain that\nwhatever Mizuki was worrying about wasn’t true, but he couldn’t decide\nwhether he should tell her or not.",
  "page_147": "“Morning!”\n“Good morning, Tatsuya, Shibata…”\nAs Tatsuya sat at a loss, Mikihiko and Erika entered the classroom, the former\nwith exhaustion lingering on his face and the latter with an air of ennui about\nher.\nAs soon as they took their seats, the start message screen appeared for the\nday’s first class.\nDuring lunch break that day, Tatsuya’s group did something a little different\nthan usual. Erika didn’t go to the cafeteria; she was slumped over her desk.\nWhen he listened closely, he could hear her snoring softly. It was probably\nbecause she couldn’t nap during the terminal-based classroom lectures.\nMikihiko complained that his head was pounding and went to the nurse’s\noffice as soon as he finished eating lunch. He seemed like the type of person\nwho got a headache rather than a fuzzy mind when he was tired. It was\nprobably just exhaustion, so Tatsuya entrusted Mizuki to go with Mikihiko.\nAnd as for Tatsuya…\n“Sorry for calling all of a sudden, Shizuku.”\n“It’s okay. What’s up?”\n“Umm, Tatsuya says he has something he really needs to ask you.”\nHe had asked Honoka to give Shizuku a call.\n“Sorry for calling so late,” he said. “I thought about sending you an e-mail, but\nit probably would have seemed garbled unless I told you in person.”\nModern communication systems, even on small, portable information\ndevices, could display such clear video it was like seeing the person in real life.\nShizuku, with whom he’d been reunited over the screen of his portable\nterminal, and who had used her own device’s calling function to respond,\nlooked a little more mature than he remembered, despite less than a month\nhaving passed.\n“It’s okay. It’s still only eight.” The girl on the screen narrowed her eyes\nslightly into a smile. As always, it was a hard expression to read, but they",
  "page_148": "understood the smile was a pretty happy one.\nHonoka and Miyuki stared hotly into their own devices. Unfortunately,\nTatsuya had Shizuku displayed in his main window, and vice versa. The\nsubwindows, even smaller on the already-tiny portable device screens,\nwouldn’t easily convey subtle changes in expression, unlike the main window.\n“Anyway, what did you need?”\n“Right,” he said. “I asked Honoka, but it looks like a vampire is making a mess\nof things over there, too. I wanted you to tell me if you knew any details about\nit.”\nOn the screen, Shizuku quirked her head to the side.\n“…Shizuku?” said Honoka.\n“…Oh, that. You mean a real vampire has appeared in Japan?”\n“‘In Japan’…?”\n“Right now, they’re still treating it like an urban legend in America. At least,\nthe media isn’t reporting on it.”\nThough they may have been different from the ones in legends and fiction,\nthings called blood-sucking vampires—or spirit-sucking ones—did indeed exist.\nIf people there were talking about the real thing, there must have been an\nincident occurring. In other words, the USNA still had a media lockdown on the\nwhole thing. It could be a far more deep-rooted issue than Tatsuya gave it\ncredit for.\n“I don’t mind if they’re only rumors—I’d like to know any details you can give\nme.”\n“Did something happen?” Shizuku leaned forward on the screen.\nTatsuya wavered over whether to tell the girl alone in another country the\ntruth that her friend had been a victim.\n“Leo ran afoul of what seemed like a vampire.”\nBut he immediately decided he should.\nOf course, even he couldn’t explain why he did so. It was just an instinctive",
  "page_149": "judgment.\n…Though maybe it was because of some sort of premonition.\n“Thankfully, his life isn’t in danger.”\n“That’s awful…”\nBut he still hadn’t wanted to give her needless anxiety. He didn’t forget to\nfollow up on what he said so Shizuku wouldn’t take too much of a shock, but\nunfortunately, it didn’t seem to have much effect.\n“No, he’ll be fine. Please, don’t make that face. Leo drove off the vampire\npersonally. He just happened to take damage from their strange ability, and\nthey’re taking good care of him in the hospital now.”\nTatsuya’s “consolation” certainly couldn’t be said to be skillful. For someone\nweak willed, saying he was in the hospital would have inflamed their anxiety\neven more.\n“He’s really all right? That’s good…”\nBut fortunately, Shizuku wasn’t the sort to drown herself in pessimistic ideas.\nAfter seeing Tatsuya give a firm nod, she sighed in relief. This sort of\ncommunication could, perhaps, be called unique to videophones.\n“I get it. That’s why you wanted to know what’s happening over here,” said\nShizuku. It was not an interrogative but a declarative remark.\nTatsuya gave his affirmation again. “But it’s not absolutely vital.” And he\ndidn’t forget to remind her of that. “Really, whatever you know is fine.”\n“But you think America has some clues. Right?”\n“Sort of. To be honest, I’m thinking the criminal behind the vampire incident\ncame here from America.”\nShizuku wasn’t the only one who gasped. He hadn’t told this theory to\nHonoka or Miyuki yet, either.\n“So I really want you to stay away from anything dangerous, Shizuku. Don’t\ncross any bridges you don’t need to. It’s not like information I can get from you\nis crucial.”",
  "page_150": "“…Okay, I won’t. So don’t get your hopes up waiting for me.”\n“Just to be sure, you’re referring to information when you say to wait for you,\nright? I can believe you when you say you won’t do anything dangerous, can’t\nI?”\n“Of course.”\nShizuku was neither an idiot nor fearless, but even after making sure a second\ntime, he still felt uneasy.\nTo Erika’s knowledge, three factions were making an organized response to\nthe vampire incidents, which were continuing to claim victims in the\nmetropolitan area.\nThe first was law enforcement, with the Tokyo MPD as its main strength,\nfollowed by both the Ministry of Police’s Wide-Area Special Investigation Team\n(also known as the Japanese FBI) and Public Safety (which was also under the\nMinistry of Police’s jurisdiction).\nThe second was the Ten Master Clans’ investigation team, with the Saegusa\nfamily taking the lead and the Juumonji family following. With backup from the\nCabinet Office Intelligence Agency and cooperating partially with the police, it\nwas a part-officer, part-civilian group. In this case, though, unusually, the\ncivilians were in the position of power.\nAnd the third was a private retaliation unit the Chiba family had organized\nwith cooperation from the Yoshida, an elite old-magic family. In other words,\nErika’s group.\n“Maybe we should have cooperated with our upperclassmen after all…?”\nThe Chiba’s unofficial but proper request to the Yoshida had abruptly made\nMikihiko a collaborator, and this was exactly the tenth time since yesterday\nhe’d asked that question.\nIt went without saying who he was talking about: Erika, his partner on this\nincident.\n“I would think just getting to use the surveillance systems, like the street",
  "page_151": "cameras and such, would give us a big efficiency boost,” he said.\n“It wouldn’t matter,” remarked Erika. “The police can use them fully, and they\nstill haven’t gotten any leads.”\n“I still think it would have been better to have help, even if it meant relying on\nothers.”\n“That’s why we’re helping each other out, isn’t it?”\n“I didn’t mean just us…” As Erika sped up her walking pace, Mikihiko stopped\ntrying to give her advice. He trotted back up next to her. “I don’t think we’ll get\nanywhere just walking around for no reason, though…”\nHe was complaining to himself now. It was too soft for Erika to hear, and even\nif she could, she would have ignored it. After all, her stubbornness was the\nexact reason he was with her at the moment.\nShinto-type old magic was the sort passed down in the Yoshida family. They\nhad a deep knowledge of divination as well, albeit not as deep as onmyoudou\nfamilies. Religious traditions in Japan didn’t provide much of a barrier against\nother technology creeping in; you could see how unprincipled they were from\nthe fact that they called themselves a Shinto family, yet used onmyoudou’s\npaper talismans as mediums.\nAfter hearing from Toshikazu that their scientific investigation was at a loss,\nthe Chiba family leader (in other words, Toshikazu and Erika’s father) had\ndecided to use technology old magicians specialized in, opting to request aid\nfrom the head of the Yoshida, the old-style family they had the closest\nrelationship with. The Chiba leader was so tone-deaf when it came to mysticism\nthat he called himself a simple barbarian without magic technology, so maybe\nhe was trying to fight occult with occult.\nWhich led to Mikihiko going along with Erika, not as a guide but as a “path\ndiviner.”\n“Which way, Miki?” asked Erika, stopping at a crossroads and turning around.\nSighing and wishing she’d listen a little more diligently, Mikihiko planted the\nrod he carried in the path. The rod was a little less than one yard tall—more\nprecisely, it was three shaku. Incidentally, he’d given up on seriously arguing",
  "page_152": "about the nickname when it was set as his default name by Lina.\nThe rod—more a slender wooden stick that happened to be straight—had\ntiny characters packed together on it, written in ink. Its cross section, though,\nhad been processed to be almost a perfect circle. He held on to its tip, stood it\nstraight up, then gently raised his hand.\nAlthough he’d “planted” it there, the ground was paved. A mere wooden stick\nwould never pierce it. Despite that, without any support from Mikihiko, it stood\non the road.\nHe took three steps backward, then whirled around. As soon as he turned his\nback, the rod lost its invisible support and fell right over. It hit the ground with a\ndry noise, pointing right at the intersection.\n“Okay, this way…”\nErika walked off in the direction the rod pointed. She didn’t wait for her\ncompanion; she didn’t even turn back to look at him.\nMikihiko gave a pained grin, picked up the rod, and followed her. But right\nbefore he got to her, he took his information terminal out of his inside pocket,\nsuddenly remembering something.\nIts transmission function was set to signal mode. After verifying that it was\nbroadcasting an identifying signal and notifying the other terminals registered\nin their group of their position, he returned it to his pocket.\nThe pained grin had disappeared from his face. He could sense they were\ngetting close to their target.\nA step behind Erika, he slowed down, maintaining the distance and taking the\nterminal out again.\nHe called up the group list of people he was transmitting to. After adding a\nnew destination, he put it away for real this time and walked up alongside his\nclassmate.\nA caped long coat and a hat pulled down over the eyes. Under the hat, a full\nface mask with a black bat depicted on gray fabric. Charles Sullivan, formerly a",

Several times\nhe sprayed Lina, her form changed to that of Angie Sirius, with psionic noise.\nHer senses lost track of him each time, but…\n“Commander, take a right at the next corner.”\nThe psion radar in the mobile base disguised as a television relay vehicle had\nlocked on to where he was and wouldn’t let go. USNA was a step ahead of\nJapan with this technology—once one of these radars, capable of identifying\npsi-wave characteristics, pinpointed your psi-wave pattern, it was almost\nimpossible to flee from it save by escaping its range. And since Lina was carrying\na palm-sized, miniaturized radar relay antenna, getting out of range was\nimpossible, too.\n“Claire, Rachel, get in front of Sullivan,” called Lina into her radio. Those were\npseudonyms: Claire for Hunter Q, or the seventeenth, and Rachel for Hunter R,\nor the eighteenth. Lina disliked calling people by their code names, and the\nones she’d given them were false names for convenience. Claire started with C\nand not Q, but they were fake anyway, so Lina didn’t see it as a problem.\nSigns of magical combat appeared twenty or thirty yards ahead. The two of\nthem were slowing Sullivan down. For Lina, he was already in range. She had a\nperfect lock on his position.\nIt might have been night, but that didn’t mean there were no other eyes\naround. They didn’t worry about that, since they were playing their game of tag\nat motorcycle speeds. Ignoring the possibility of the police intervening, Lina\ntook out a small knife—a dagger.\nShe was going too fast; it didn’t look like any pedestrians saw the dagger. The\nmatte black blade wouldn’t stand out even in the sunlight anyway. Without\ntrying to hide it, she flung her dagger forward.",
  "page_154": "It soared under the streetlights, then turned as Lina guided it.\nThis blade was an integrated armament CAD. Simply throwing it activated its\nmovement spell, and it would follow a route set by the caster and pierce the\ntarget. The dagger she threw changed direction several times in midair before\nshooting at Sullivan’s back.\nSullivan sensed the blade flying at him right before it hit. Even the physical\nabilities of a vampire didn’t give him enough time to dodge it. But having\nrecovered his psychic abilities, he judged that his own skill at influencing the\ntrajectory of physical objects would be sufficient.\nHe concentrated on the weapon. When he turned around, the hunters he was\ncurrently fighting charged him. Friendly fire, he willed in his mind. The small\nblade flying at his front should have turned and struck a hunter behind him.\nBut a voiceless cry of pain slipped from Sullivan’s mouth.\nHis vector reflection spell had zero effect on Lina’s movement spell.\nThe difference in their levels of event influence was too great.\nRealizing his own strength wasn’t enough, Sullivan immediately flung up his\nright arm. Lina’s dagger dug deeply into it.\nSullivan’s body froze.\nHunter R’s combat knife gouged his back.\nIf he were a normal human, it would have been fatal.\nBut Sullivan whipped his arm around in a sideways punch, sending the knife-\nwielding R reeling.\nThe masked magician showed herself then. Her golden eyes pierced Sullivan’s\nthrough his mask.\nLina now stopped, pulled out a pistol.\nSuddenly, an electric attack was fired at her from the shadows of the trees on\nthe roadside.",

Rubber soles—probably one\nmaking an escape and one pursuing.\nThey traded glances.\nA moment later, without exchanging any signals, they began to run, Erika\ntoward the indications of fighting, and Mikihiko toward the stir among the\nspirits.\nWith different senses, but the same hunch: They’d found them.\nErika took a slight lead, and Mikihiko followed behind.\nAs she ran, Erika took an unsheathed katana from the long, slender case\nhanging on her shoulder. Though it didn’t have a blade, its entire surface was\nengraved with spell seals—an armament device made by the Isori family. Kei\nIsori had given it to her as a gift, as a substitute for the Orochi-Maru, since the\nlatter stood out too much in public. It might not have been as strong as the\nOrochi-Maru, but it had the ability to support momentum-control spells.",
  "page_157": "Meanwhile, Mikihiko, holding the rod two fist lengths down the shaft in his\nright hand, swung his left hand diagonally downward. What looked like a folding\nfan burst from his sleeve; he grabbed it with his left hand.\nIt was like an iron-ribbed fan, connecting long, slender strips of thin metallic\npaper to a fan-shaped frame. Each of those strips was a single paper talisman\nwith an incantation or spell circle engraved on it. The ribs, molded to the strips,\nwere lines through which the caster’s psions passed. A cord extending from the\nfan’s pivot was hooked up to a psion pattern oscillation unit hidden in his\nsleeve.\nThis, too, was a type of CAD. In order to reproduce old magic’s two-step\nactivation process of talisman and chanting, Mikihiko had compiled ideas based\non advice from Tatsuya and had a regular Yoshida family engineer create this: a\nnew type of old-magic casting assistance tool.\nAfter getting themselves ready for combat, the two of them chased the\nfootsteps. Sometimes their rhythm would fall apart completely, probably\nbecause the people running were stopping intermittently to trade blows before\nrunning off again.\nEven if they hadn’t been, Erika’s and Mikihiko’s feet were faster. They burst\nthrough a back road lined with midsize buildings, and in a small disaster-\nprevention park (more precisely, a damage buffer for natural disasters), they\nfinally spotted their targets.\nTwo figures mingled. One hid its face and body under a hooded coat, and the\nother wore a mask that covered its eye area.\nBoth of them appeared female.\n“Miki, you take the one with the coat. I’ll stop the one with the mask!”\nChecking against Leo’s testimony, the suspicious one was the one with the\nhooded coat. But anyone hiding their face with a mask this late at night would\nalways be suspicious.

It wasn’t conceit on her part, either: In the\ninstant between Erika swinging the sword up and bringing it back down, this\nperson had chosen a spell and triggered it.\nThe masked magician had moved right under a streetlight.

Erika had had the initiative thus far, but her\ncombat sense told her that if she was forced to go on the defensive, her odds of\nvictory would be hopeless.\nLetting a chance escape would be fatal.\nFortunately for her, the masked woman was impatient.

No burns\nor cut marks. In other words, thought Mikihiko, the one Leo had fought\nwouldn’t use fire, electricity, or blades.\nIf they used a weapon, it would be a blunt one. If not, then strikes.\nTheir method of attack, at least for the moment, was just as he’d guessed\nbeforehand.\nIf he’d miscalculated anything, it had been this enemy’s incomparable speed\nand power.\nThe female vampire—as Mikihiko dubbed her for convenience’s sake in his\nown mind—flung a fist toward him.

  "page_163": "Thunder Child was a spell that reproduced a small-scale lightning strike in a\ntight area. It was a degraded, scaled-down version of Invoke Lightning, a\nweather-control spell that created a thundercloud to emulate real lightning, but\nthough its amperage was lesser, its voltage compared favorably.\nWith an explosive roar of electric breakdown, lightning fired from the source\nto other electrodes he’d set up in the air—at the crown of the vampire’s head.\nAt the moment this spell activated, it was already sure to hit. A lightning strike\ntraveling at two hundred thousand kilometers per second bolted toward her\nhead.\nA beast-like, piercing cry rang out. But that immediately changed into a shout\nmore suitable for the voice. The flash of light, which should have penetrated his\ntarget’s body and disappeared, instead moved to the woman’s hands as she\nplaced them over her head. Electric sparks crackled from her fingertips. The\nlight had a stronger electric force than the lightning Mikihiko had created.\nEmission-type magic!\nSpells that extracted electrons from a physical body were basic techniques in\none of modern magic’s eight types: emission. Because it pinpointed the\ninformation directly linked to the phenomenon of electron distribution and\noverwrote it, emission-type magic could generally output stronger electric\nattacks than old magic’s lightning-type spells.\nMikihiko flung himself to the ground, and an electric light buzzed over, grazing\nhim.\nCompared to old lightning magic, modern emission-type spells were superior\nin power but inferior in control. Because of that, he was able to dodge the first\nattack. But at zero range, he knew he wouldn’t be able to avoid the literally\nlightning-fast attacks forever.\nCursing his lack of forethought for unconsciously assuming his opponent\nwould only use one type of attack, he hastily built a defensive spell. Then he\ncalled forth one that created a layer of air as a barrier, thick enough that no\nelectric breakdown would occur.\nHowever, his opponent was already using her magic.

Tatsuya would\nhave offered, except for the fact that his blouson was hiding a shoulder holster,\nwhich would have been problematic to reveal.\n“Thanks. I’m fine now.”\nIt wasn’t like she’d been naked, or even half-naked. Tatsuya’s unadulterated\nimpression was that she was making a big deal out of nothing, but maybe that\nwas a kind of beauty of style. And certainly it was several steps better than\nhaving no shame about it.\n“Erika, are you hurt?” He’d found out what he could from looking at her, but\nhe decided to ask anyway.\n“It was a good thing I wore an acton just in case. If I hadn’t, things would’ve",
  "page_169": "been real bad there.”\nActon was another anachronistic term, with a further option being gambeson,\nbut Tatsuya knew, by good luck or coincidence, that it was completely unlike\nwhat actons originally were. Rather than a thick garment worn underneath\narmor to soften impacts and keep the skin safe, what Erika referred to as an\nacton was underwear made of multifunctional synthetic rubber that served as\narmor against bullets and blades. Unlike thick body armor, it didn’t obstruct the\nwearer’s movement, and since you could wear it underneath your clothes, it\ncarried the advantage of not drawing unwanted attention. In exchange,\nbecause of its materials, it was designed to cling to your body, so those wanting\nto hide their shape didn’t like them. Normally, since she wore outerwear on top\nof it, there was no reason to mind it, but this time, it wasn’t about the wearer;\nher companions had found the image of the acton clinging to her body\ntempting.\n“It seems like wind blades were in that blast.”\n“Looks like it… That masked jerk. Next time I see her, I’m making her pay for\nthese clothes.”\n“I think you hurt her collarbone pretty good.”\n“That’s a completely separate issue!”\nLike Tatsuya said, Erika wasn’t beaten one-sidedly—she’d gotten in a little\ngoing-away present. The hit had been shallow, but just before the shock wave\nblew her away, her katana had connected with the masked magician’s right\nshoulder.\nTatsuya hadn’t been there to see, but between the masked magician’s\nappearance and the way Erika’s clothes were damaged, he’d accurately\ndeduced what had happened.\n“By the way, Tatsuya, why are you here?”\nHe could tell by Erika’s face that she hadn’t suddenly thought of the question\n—she’d been itching to ask the whole time. Tatsuya considered several avenues\nof how to answer, but in the end decided to be honest—because he thought it\nwould be most interesting that way.",
  "page_170": "“What do you mean? Mikihiko contacted me.”\nDisturbance shot through Mikihiko’s face as he looked at Tatsuya as if he\nwere a traitor.\n“Really, now?”\nBut at the indeed highly unhappy voice, Mikihiko awkwardly shifted his gaze\nto Erika.\n“And our savior came to rescue us just in the nick of time. That was a nice\nplay, Miki.”\nHer words were complimentary, and given what had led to this state of\naffairs, one should have judged the action worthy of praise.\nStill, Mikihiko could only force out fragmented words like uh and well.\nThe volume of her voice entering his ears did not, in any way, strike him as a\ncompliment.\n“When did you contact him, by the way? I don’t remember asking you.”\n“…”\nOf course she didn’t remember asking him—he hadn’t told her at all. It was\nentirely his own decision to send their tracer signal to Tatsuya. And without\ngiving him any other information, either. Even if she pressed him further, not\neven he would be able to answer what he was trying to do by doing that.\nErika’s cold gaze on him, a bead of sweat formed on Mikihiko’s temple. He\nwas like a frog under a snake’s glare. Mikihiko getting out of this himself\nseemed difficult, so Tatsuya decided that was enough: “I know you both seem\nconfused, but shouldn’t we move?”\nErika blinked twice at the voice addressing them from the side and took out\nher information terminal, which had just barely stayed safe.\n“People are starting to gather, you know.”\nMikihiko, flustered at Tatsuya’s remarks, too, took out his own terminal.\nErika checked the time. It had been about five minutes since they\nencountered the vampire and the masked magician. It wouldn’t be strange for",
  "page_171": "other teams to start getting here.\nMikihiko brought up his tracer monitor. The lights displaying allied search\nteams were approaching in random curved paths. It was easy to imagine they\ndid so lest they run across any other search teams.\n“You didn’t get the Clans’ permission, right?”\nAt the moment, there was no penalty set in stone just because they hadn’t\nparticipated in the official search team that the Saegusa family had organized.\nBut diving into combat while ignoring the Saegusa-Juumonji search team was\nthe sort of thing they wanted to pretend hadn’t happened… Especially if the\nformer student council president found them. Erika and Mikihiko could sense\nthat would lead to all sorts of problems in the future.\nAs they worried over this and that, Tatsuya, without thinking about anything\nunnecessary, prepared for their escape.\n“Erika, want a ride?” he asked, getting back on his bike.\n“Yeah, please.” Erika bounded over, jumped into the tandem seat, and clung\nto Tatsuya’s waist.\n“What about me, Tats?” asked Mikihiko, fretting.\n“Sorry. That would be too many people,” Tatsuya answered, turning on the\nmotor.\nMikihiko sucked in an affronted breath, then shouted: “You’ll get fined for not\nwearing a helmet!”\nThe protest met only Tatsuya’s back as he rode away.\n(Additionally, in the late twenty-first century, there was no defined penalty\nfor helmet-wearing delinquency. Instead, if a passenger was fatally wounded in\nan accident, a dangerous driving fatal wound penalty would be applied to the\ndriver’s record.) Mikihiko, coat taken and left behind, stood there in a daze for\nquite a while.\nLina—still in her Angie Sirius form—returned to their mobile base, which was\ndisguised as a television relay vehicle, and ordered a withdrawal before she",
  "page_172": "even sat down.\nThere was no question. That, in itself, was as she’d predicted. As she took her\nseat in the back, the mobile base began to move without a sound. But the\nvehicle was filled with a dubious air, a desire to ask the question but a fear of\ndoing so. Her hair was a mess and her boots were dirty with the vestiges of\nflash bangs, almost as though she’d run away. But for Sirius, commander of the\nStars, the term run away was an unseemly one.\n“Major.”\nThe ceiling in the vehicle was high, but her two team members still had to\nbend over as they stood in front of Lina.\n“We’re terribly sorry.”\nTheir apology was for falling behind during their pursuit. Lina had been\nfighting the vampire alone because her other team members couldn’t keep up\nwith her movement speed.\n“It doesn’t matter. There may have been unexpected third-party interference,\nbut I fled as well.”\n“…Thank you, ma’am.”\n“Anyway, we’ve already dealt with Sergeant Sullivan, so I wouldn’t necessarily\ncall this mission a failure. Have you recovered his corpse?”\n“Yes, Major.”\n“I see.” Lina nodded, looking relieved at the answer that came from behind\nwhere the two of them stood. “Please send the sergeant’s corpse for an\nautopsy right away. And did you figure out what I was chasing?” she asked, her\nexpression immediately tightening up.\n“I’m sorry, Major. We successfully extracted the psi-wave pattern this time,\nbut it didn’t match any of the data.”\n“Then either she isn’t a fugitive…or her psi-wave patterns have been altered.”\n“I believe it’s likely the latter, Major.”\n“All right. Trace the pattern we picked up.”",
  "page_173": "“Yes, ma’am.”\nAfter hearing the answer and instructing the two in front of her to return to\ntheir seats, Lina sat back deeply in her own seat.\nShe brought her left hand to her right shoulder and applied healing magic to\nherself. She was able to keep a straight face in front of her subordinates thanks\nto her magic-based transformation, but her collarbone had completely broken\nafter she’d forced herself to use her gun when it was already fractured. It hurt\nso much she wanted to cry.\nNobody told me Erika would be that strong! And Tatsuya used some crazy skill\nor magic or something to disable my spells… Are all high schoolers in Japan like\nthat?! complained Lina to herself, leaving her own age aside for the moment.\n“I’m sorry? Our aunt…?”\nTatsuya had left the room in haste a moment ago, after taking his terminal\nout of his breast pocket. Once he returned from that disappearance, Miyuki\nrepeated back what he’d just said: the name of the woman he wanted her to\nspeak to.\nAnd after she said it, she was ashamed of her rudeness.\nTatsuya, of course, couldn’t blame her for asking the question like that, but\neven if he could, it would take more than that to make him displeased with her.\n“I have something I’d like to discuss with her,” he repeated, asking her again\nto make the call.\nMost of the Yotsuba family servants knew Tatsuya was Maya’s nephew. They\nalso knew that, as part of the Yotsuba family, Tatsuya was nothing more than a\ntool—though few knew he was a weapon. Even if he called Maya, it was\nentirely possible they’d hang up instead of transferring him over to her.\nNevertheless, neither Tatsuya nor even Miyuki was allowed to know her\ndirect number. Anyone who knew the circumstances would unanimously state\nthat the Yotsuba family’s information controls were several levels higher than\neven the prime minister’s official residence, and that was no exaggeration.",
  "page_174": "“If it’s your command, Brother… Might you wait a moment?”\n“Yeah… I’ll go get changed.”\nDespite their blood relation, he couldn’t take the call in his normal clothes,\nnor could he cut the video feed—for the siblings, that was the kind of person\ntheir aunt (and her household) was.\n“I apologize for the lateness of the call.”\n“It’s fine. I’m just surprised you wanted to call me, Miyuki.”\nAs always, she featured age-indeterminate beauty and an indecipherable\nsmile when she appeared on the videophone screen. Next to her was Hayama,\nwearing a perfectly fitted three-piece suit. Tatsuya thought to himself that\nhaving a butler sit in on a call between aunt and niece was a little lacking in\ncommon sense, but he was also standing next to Miyuki in a dark suit, so the\nroad went both ways.\nAfter they briefly exchanged regular greetings, tension hidden behind her\ncalm expression, Miyuki explained, in an even more businesslike tone—it was\nprobably hard for her to come out and say it—that Tatsuya had something to\ndiscuss with Maya.\n“Tatsuya? Well, that’s another surprise.”\nNot bothering to conceal the amusement in her smile, Maya allowed Tatsuya\nto make a remark.\n“Aunt Maya, I actually have one thing I’d like to ask, and one thing I’d like to\nhave your permission on.”\n“You may ask away,” nodded Maya in good temper. On the surface, at least.\n“Then, if I may… Aunt Maya, would you please tell me how the Kudou family’s\nParade spell works?”\nNext to Tatsuya, Miyuki gave him a blank, baffled look.\nOn the other end of the video, Hayama dexterously raised a single eyebrow.\nMaya gave a laugh, as though she couldn’t help it any longer. “Oh my…\nTatsuya, Parade is the Kudou family’s secret technique. Why would you think I’d",
  "page_175": "know its mysteries?”\nLaughing again, Maya gave him a no in the form of a question.\n“There was a time when you received instruction from His Excellency.\nWouldn’t you know the idea, even if not the magic program itself?”\nKnowing she meant she couldn’t tell him, he used her question against her to\nstand his ground.\n“Is the anti-magic spell Parade for duplicating and processing parts related to\nyour own eidos’s outward appearance through the application of Information\nBoost in order to project a different appearance onto yourself? In other words,\nthrough masking or disguising eidos, one temporarily alters their physical\nappearance, while also substituting any magical interference aims with their\nown disguised eidos to block the usage of magic on the true body?”\nBut not only did he stand his ground—he added in his own deductions.\n“…I had thought you, of all people, would be very familiar with the\nimpossibilities of transformation magic.”\nMaya didn’t express a direct answer to Tatsuya’s theory. That was enough for\nhim to know whether his deduction was correct, but it still didn’t satisfy him.\n“If all you want to do is alter your appearance, you can do it by interfering\nwith light waves, though it’s not true transformation. The issue lies in that light\ninterference can’t fool my ‘eyes.’”\n“Brother, you don’t mean…” said Miyuki, surprise evident on her face. “There\nwas someone who could keep their identity secret from you?”\n“Not only that. It caused my Mist Dispersion to miss.”\nMiyuki’s face paled, and she lost her voice.\nAs though her shock had been transmitted through the screen, Maya\nfurrowed her brow into a scowl for a moment. Her smile quickly returned, but\nshe was finished playing games.\n“Even if Mist Dispersion didn’t work, Trident wouldn’t cause a problem, right?”\n“Can you not deploy a two-layered Parade?”",
  "page_176": "Maya had given him “advice,” but she didn’t answer his follow-up question.\nInstead, she answered a different question, one he hadn’t asked aloud.\n“I do recall hearing that the Old Master’s younger brother was more skilled\nthan he was.”\n“Thank you. Aunt Maya, this incident seems like too much for me to handle. I\nwould like to request reinforcements.”\n“Is that the matter you wanted permission for?”\nAunt and nephew exchanged looks over the display.\n“…Very well. Things seem to be shifting past the scope of our expectations. I\nwill permit you to contact Major Kazama.”\nTatsuya bowed, then withdrew from the screen.",
  "page_177": "The usual way to school on a usual morning: He and Miyuki left the station,\nmet up with their friends, and headed for school. One member had been\nmissing since the new year and another since the middle of last week, but aside\nfrom that, this morning looked the same as they had since last spring.\nThis morning, however, a very unusual event was waiting for Tatsuya. Before\nthey met up with their friends, when they were still at the ticket gate, an\nupperclassman called out to him. Both he and Miyuki had noticed her there\nbefore she said anything.\nThis station was mainly used by First High students or related people at this\ntime of day. Unlike with the high-capacity trains of old, you wouldn’t see dense\ncrowds of passengers coming off the platforms very often in stations these\ndays. Nevertheless, the siblings walked over to where Mayumi was standing\nnear the wall so they wouldn’t get in the way of the students flooding out as\nclass time approached.\nNo few students cast glances their way, but none of them seemed to care\nmuch. It wasn’t strange for the former student council president to be standing\nand talking to the current vice president, and it was widely assumed at First\nHigh that the current vice president’s older brother was a favorite of the former\nstudent council president—including in a gossipy way.\nThe reality was, of course, nothing that would meet their expectations. Rather\nthan walking to school with her, the siblings left the ticket gates ahead of her.\nMayumi only had one thing to say: to meet her in the crossfield club’s second\nroom after school.\nThe crossfield club (a club dedicated to a survival game using magic tactics)\nwas the club Katsuto belonged to. There was a tacit understanding at First High",
  "page_178": "that the club committee used its second club room as an unofficial meeting\nplace, and many were aware that Katsuto used it for private matters even after\nretiring from the club. As expected, when Tatsuya arrived, Mayumi and Katsuto\nwere waiting for him.\n“Alone?”\nSurprise rolled off of not only Katsuto, who asked the question, but Mayumi\nas well.\n“Yes, since I was the only one called here.”\nIn truth, Miyuki had firmly insisted on going with him, but he’d managed to\nwheedle her out of it—going with her to a cake buffet on his dime would be a\nsmall price to pay.\nWhatever the reason, Tatsuya had indeed come by himself. Technically,\nMayumi had only summoned him, but she hadn’t predicted Miyuki wouldn’t\ncome, too. But without wasting time on that, she got right to the main topic.\n“Tatsuya, did you go out last night?”\nShe led off with one of the several questions Tatsuya had imagined. “Yes, I\ndid,” he politely admitted, instead of the more typical So what? of people his\nage.\n“On a motorcycle?”\n“Yes.”\nPeople got talkative when they wanted to fool someone. Right now, Tatsuya\nhad no motive to deceive with loquaciousness.\n“…Will you tell me where you went?”\nMayumi, on the other hand, seemed to be having trouble deciding where to\ntake the conversation. She didn’t seem to have enough deviousness or\nexperience in feeling someone out. Katsuto, standing quietly beside her, didn’t\nseem cut out for the job, either.\n“Yoshida called me while in combat with the vampire. They were fighting the\nindividual there, as well as an unknown magician who was probably chasing the\nvampire.”",
  "page_179": "This seems like it’ll take a while, thought Tatsuya, deciding to push the\nconversation forward. Mayumi blinked in surprise as he directed an unreadable\ngaze at her. Even an adult with a bigger wealth of experience—her father, for\nexample—probably would have had a hard time reading his thoughts.\nShe didn’t know what he was thinking.\nAnd that thought stirred unease within her, shook her psychological defenses.\n“Since what time?” inquired Katsuto suddenly, maybe throwing Mayumi a life\nraft, maybe not.\n“I only drove there because they called me yesterday. I wasn’t part of the\nvampire search,” answered Tatsuya, supplying even what wasn’t asked to the\nquestion that cut out all sorts of things, like who and what. It didn’t matter\nwhat Katsuto and Mayumi thought—Tatsuya had no intention of playing this\ngame of scoping each other out right now.\n“You two know that Saijou in Class 1-E was attacked, right?”\nThere was no universe in which they wouldn’t have known. This wasn’t a\nquestion, but a verification. The answer he got back was, of course, affirmative.\n“I’m not the only one who wants to know what in the world is going on. We\ncan’t feel safe at all until we’ve found the criminal, handed them over, and put\nan end to it. I’m sure you can’t tolerate the curtains closing before even\nknowing whether there’s just one perpetrator, multiple, or whether it’s an\ninfectious crime, right?”\nHe was talking to both of them, but now he turned his gaze to Mayumi in\nparticular. “Unless you tell me how much of the situation you understand and\nhow you plan on solving it, I can’t very well cooperate.”\nThough her initiative had been stolen, she seemed to rally her nerves. After a\nsigh, her false smile disappeared. “If you promise you’ll help us, Tatsuya, I’ll tell\nyou what we know so far,” she said. “But no telling anyone else. I’m sure you\nknow that.”\n“Understood. I’ll help you.” Tatsuya nodded without a moment’s delay.\nThat was the answer she’d hoped for, but since she couldn’t figure out his",
  "page_180": "true intentions, her eyes narrowed at him inquisitively. “…Does that mean you’ll\njoin our search team?”\n“You may take it as such if you wish.”\n“Why this, all of a sudden? You must have seen the notification from the\nClans Council.”\nThose were Katsuto’s words. After the Saegusa and Juumonji had created\ntheir joint vampire-hunting team, a notification requesting assistance had gone\nout from the Clans Council to the leaders of the Ten Master Clans, the Eighteen\nSupport Clans, and the Hundred Families. No high school student would have\nlaid eyes on it if they weren’t a direct descendant of one of the Numbers, but\nKatsuto spoke as though Tatsuya had, in fact, read the Clans Council notification\nthrough some means.\n“As someone who isn’t even part of the Hundred, I didn’t think there was any\nroom for me.”\nAnd Tatsuya didn’t hide the fact that he’d seen the notification. Notifications\nfrom the council weren’t designated confidential, so they weren’t actually that\nhard to get your hands on.\n“If I’d been personally requested, things would have been different, though.”\nHis answer reeked of feigned ignorance. But as a facade, though it wasn’t\nperfect, it left no room for complaints, and nothing in particular stood out as\nstrange. Thus, Mayumi and Katsuto, regardless of whatever they were actually\nthinking, had no choice but to agree in form.\nBecause, after all, even before the sums of their experience came into play,\nTatsuya already had a meaner personality than either of them.\n“…But are you sure? Didn’t you say your condition was that I share\ninformation before you’d cooperate?”\n“One of us has to yield, or the conversation wouldn’t get anywhere. What? If I\ndecided you’d tricked me, I’d simply change my attitude.”\nAt the too-honest words—or words that looked too honest, but might have\nactually had something behind them, then something behind that, and then",
  "page_181": "behind that again—Mayumi let out a dry laugh. She’d been the one to bring up\nthis confidential talk, but she already felt like getting it over with quick.\n“Great. I’ll explain everything we know at this stage. But before that, can I say\nsomething?”\n“What is it?”\n“You really are an awful person.”\n“……”\nThere were three bits in the information Mayumi gave that were altogether\nnew for Tatsuya.\nOne was the scope of the damage. It greatly exceeded Tatsuya’s predictions,\nbut that didn’t seem all that vital.\nThe second was that the crimes didn’t seem to be the work of a single\ncriminal. Tatsuya had considered accomplices, too, but the possibility of there\nbeing more than one vampire was unexpected.\nAnd third was the presence of a third faction obstructing Mayumi and\nKatsuto’s search. At first, when she said obstructing faction, Tatsuya’s mind had\nleaped to Erika and Mikihiko. But after hearing the specifics, he learned it was\nan entirely separate group.\nThe second and third pieces of info worried even him. That masked magician\nprobably belonged to the group impeding their search. And he had a pretty\ncertain guess as to her identity.\nBut he didn’t know her motive. He got the feeling that once he knew, it would\nall be very simple, but that just made it more annoying.\n“What do you two plan to do when you capture the vampires?”\nAvoiding the foolish act of wandering into a dark alley in his thoughts, Tatsuya\npulled his mind back to the topic. He’d said he’d cooperate, and even if it was\nonly a surface-level promise, he couldn’t neglect to find out their endgame.\n“We’ll interrogate them and learn their identities and goals. After that…”\n“They’ll probably be dealt with,” said Katsuto, filling in for what Mayumi was",
  "page_182": "having a hard time saying.\nI mean… Tatsuya didn’t want to hear a female high school student throwing\naround terms like dealing with, either, so he didn’t consider her naive.\nAnd their solution didn’t insist on humaneness; it was one Tatsuya could\nunderstand, both practically and emotionally.\n“…Understood. What should I do?”\n“Would you mind coming along with us? Starting tonight, if possible—”\n“No, Shiba, you move on your own. I’d like you to report any clues you might\ncome up with.”\nMayumi stared at Katsuto as he cut off her instructions. Her gaze held no\ndispleasure, but there was enough suspicion to make up for it.\n“I understand.”\nIn all honesty, it would have been easier for Tatsuya to do what Mayumi said.\nOf course, he had no intention of seriously keeping his promise to cooperate\nwith them, which was why he could agree without hesitation to Katsuto’s\nproposition.\nWithout revealing the cards in his own hand and having heard everything he\nwanted to hear for himself, he left them.\nOnce Tatsuya’s footsteps had gone out of earshot (concealed microphones for\ndetecting spies’ movements were set up around the room), Mayumi opened\nher mouth.\n“Juumonji, why did you tell Tatsuya to act separately?” Her tone wasn’t\ncriticizing, but she was unconvinced.\n“I thought it would be more efficient,” answered Katsuto.\nShe couldn’t feel a lack of confidence from him. “But that could mean giving\nhim to the Chiba.”\nMayumi also knew that Erika’s group had disobeyed the notification and was\nacting on its own. The Saegusa might have been a leader in the Ten Master\nClans, but they weren’t rulers, so they couldn’t easily force the Chiba to stop,",
  "page_183": "nor could they levy any penalties on them. But in a situation where a foreign\nfaction was peeking through the shadows, letting them run about on their own\nwas an inconvenient bother. Her true position was that even if they couldn’t do\nanything about the combination of Erika Chiba and Mikihiko Yoshida, she at\nleast wanted to get the Shiba siblings on their side.\n“If we hadn’t told him the truth, it’s possible that could have happened,”\nKatsuto muttered. He shook his head, implying that it wasn’t a current concern.\n“But now that we’ve shown him our sincerity, he won’t betray us. That’s the\nkind of man he is.”\n“…A thoroughly give-and-take relationship, huh? That’s a weird form of trust.”\n“Even the loyalty of a samurai, at its roots, was about goodwill and service—\ngive and take. I personally think we can trust him much more than someone\nwho was blindly obedient.”\n“…At the root of absolute loyalty lies dependence, after all. We can’t expect\nthat from Tatsuya. And it wouldn’t make sense for him anyway.”\nKatsuto nodded. Mayumi nodded back, convinced.\nAt this stage, he’d have to be satisfied with putting pieces of the puzzle\ntogether even if he knew he was missing a crucial piece. While once again\nmentally searching through the information he’d acquired thus far, Tatsuya\nhurried to the student council room, where Miyuki was waiting for him.\nIt was still light out. But of course it was—today was Saturday. School had\nended, but noon had only just passed. He was hurrying not because they were\ngoing to be late getting home, but because they were going to be late for lunch.\nMiyuki would never eat without waiting for him. Maybe she would if he had\ncarefully instructed (ordered?) her to, but he didn’t think he’d be that late\ntoday, so he hadn’t. He hadn’t actually made her wait very long, but knowing he\nwas making his little sister wait was enough to put pressure on even Tatsuya.\nBirds of a feather, one might call the two of them.\nPutting his physical abilities to use, he dashed up the stairs two at a time and\nwent to the student council room. When he got there, the door was open, as",
  "page_184": "though it were waiting for him.\nThe first thing that came into view was a golden radiance.\nAt almost the same time, Tatsuya stepped to the side and Lina hid behind the\ndoor. They both waited, the door between them for the other to walk past.\nTatsuya’s lips pulled up a little at how ridiculous he must have looked, and then\nhe went through the doorway, the one barring (?) the way gone.\nHe was purposely ignoring the concept of “ladies first” while making sure not\nto ignore the lady herself.\n“Hey, Lina. How are you doing?” he asked, turning to her as he passed, lightly\ntapping her right shoulder.\n“Hi, Tatsuya. I’m great. Thanks.”\nDespite the sudden physical contact, she didn’t complain of sexual\nharassment. Her answer was given without a single wrinkle in her brow but\nwith a smile, and as if in exchange, she patted Tatsuya’s shoulder twice and left.\nTatsuya waved down Miyuki and Honoka—they’d stood up happily upon\nseeing him—and took a seat at the table (on a chair at the table, actually) which\nhe couldn’t quite decide whether to call a conference table or not. He obviously\ndidn’t want to give much thought to its having been purchased so student\ncouncil members could use it to dine and take tea breaks.\nAzusa and Isori were nowhere to be found. He couldn’t have criticized them\neven if they were here, but he was still more comfortable without them. Not\nbecause upperclassmen being in the same room made him nervous, but\nbecause he’d have to take them into consideration. Azusa, especially, would\nlook frightened as soon as the slightest thing happened (or so Tatsuya figured).\nMayumi’s summons had been completely unexpected, so they hadn’t\nprepared their own lunches. Of course, if someone suddenly said “I thought this\nmight happen,” he’d doubtless be less impressed and more scared. Knowing a\nlot would be sold out already, there would be no lack of fuss going to the\ncafeteria now, so they decided to make use of the dining server in the student\ncouncil room for the first time in a while.\nHonoka used the cooking panel to prepare a drink for Miyuki. Tatsuya’s job",
  "page_185": "was to stay put and let himself be waited on… Looking at him objectively would\nhave made him an object of envy, but he cut off that unproductive idea before\nit made it to his conscious mind.\n“What was Lina here for, by the way?” he asked, instead going with the\nthought that did come to mind.\n“The school suggested that Lina could possibly be a temporary student council\nmember for the length of her study-abroad program,” answered Miyuki as she\nplaced a coffee cup in front of him and leaned over to the side to look at him.\nHer straight black hair flowed down like a waterfall before his eyes.

It looks like the recruitment wars are growing quite severe below the\nsurface… Apparently, Chairman Hattori was the one to propose Lina’s position\non the council.”\nThat answer came from Honoka as she brought over a tray with steaming\nplates on it. She made a U-turn, then they both went around the table, took\ntheir own trays, and started eating.\n“Her program ends after one school term, so she obviously couldn’t join an\nathletic club,” agreed Tatsuya.\n“People seem to have a different ulterior motive,” offered Miyuki, giving a\nslightly mean smile. “Apparently some people had the ridiculous plan of making\na photo collection of her and selling it.”\nHonoka frowned and sighed. “Do we even have a photography club?”\nIt wouldn’t be strange to have a club like that, but Tatsuya couldn’t remember\none existing.\n“It was the photography team of the art club. Their idea, dull as it is, is to have\nher join the light gymnastics club and take pictures of her doing that.”\nLight gymnastics was a magicians-only gymnastics event performed with",

Tatsuya looked in the other direction.\nHe got the same stare in that direction, too.\n“…Sorry. I didn’t say that properly,” he said, looking back at his sister and\nholding aloft the white flag. If it came to a staring contest with his enthusiastic\ngaze, the two girls would more than likely be the first to break, but he’d figured\nusing their feelings for something so petty would be incredibly uncool.\nMeanwhile, Miyuki knew Tatsuya had no rude intentions, which meant that\nwhen humbled like this, she couldn’t refrain from feeling awkward and casting\nher eyes down.\n“A-anyway, I’ve heard similar things here and there, and it’s not only Lina—\nthe fires might start spreading to people who have nothing to do with\nrecruitment, too, and, um…”\nHonoka showed panic at the strange mood. Despite having an opinionated\nside to her, she was basically a person with delicate sensibilities (also called\ntimid).\n“And they thought the student council would be a good fit,” remarked\nTatsuya, immediately understanding her consideration.\n“Yes,” followed Miyuki without a moment’s delay. “All the other clubs should\ngive up if she refuses even student council work.”\nSeeing the strange air drifting between the siblings swept away, Honoka\nbreathed a sigh of relief. Unfortunately (?) for her, she was far from the type of\ngirl devious enough to take advantage of them fighting.",
  "page_187": "“What did Lina think about it?”\n“She didn’t seem very happy with the idea,” answered Miyuki.\n“I don’t think she wanted to give up her time after school,” said Honoka. “I\nthought maybe that was why she hasn’t decided on a club yet, despite all the\neager invitations.”\nTatsuya nodded, looking convinced.\nAfter their weekend dinner, Tatsuya sat on the living room sofa watching the\nlarge screen on the wall.\nNext to him, Miyuki sat so close she was almost snuggling up with him.\nThe screen was divided in three. The main section showed a real-time video\nfeed of the Tokyo metropolitan area from the stratospheric security cameras,\nwith three different points of light moving atop it. The upper subsection had a\nroad map corresponding to the main section and lights moving on it, while the\nlower subsection displayed text data that scrolled by every thirty seconds.\nIt was thanks to Captain Sanada that he could use the surveillance cameras on\nthe stratospheric platform. And it was because of the once-in-a-generation\nhacker Kyouko Fujibayashi’s job that he could monitor the tracer signals from\nthe Saegusa-Juumonji family federation, not because he’d squeezed the\nauthentication codes out of Mayumi. Fujibayashi was also the one who had\npicked out the Chiba search team’s signal.\nThe luminous point thought to be the interfering faction was generated with\nconstant analysis by the Independent Magic Battalion’s supercomputer of the\nelectric waves being detected by the interception and monitoring radios aboard\nthe stratospheric platform.\nFrom his long relationship with the Independent Magic Battalion, Tatsuya had\nhad a vague understanding that the experimental magic force was also an\nexperimental cutting-edge tech force (if not, they couldn’t have built the\nMOVAL suits), but once again, he felt like he’d been blindsided by their\nexceptional capabilities.\nAnd in terms of technology…",
  "page_188": "“The Stars seem to have better tech than us searching for the parasite,”\nmuttered Tatsuya, impressed, deciding the interfering faction was the Stars and\nwatching them move.\nThey couldn’t directly pinpoint the parasite’s movements, but they could\napproximate them by analyzing the routes of the three factions looking for the\nvampire. And the moving light designated as the Stars, despite not being able to\nuse the roadside cameras and their sensors or the measurement devices on the\nstratospheric platform, seemed to be tracing the parasite’s motions the\nquickest. Tatsuya couldn’t tell if it was a spell they didn’t know of or more\nadvanced technology. He also had no way of knowing whether the parasite was\nthe only thing the Stars could trace or whether it could isolate other magical\nsignals as well. The one thing he could say for sure was that the USNA was\nahead of Japan in this field.\nHe’d never believed Japan’s magic technology was on the forefront of the\nworld to begin with. He also wasn’t conceited enough to think they possessed\nevery kind of tech. Still, he found it hard to suppress his chagrin and his earnest\ndesire to seek answers.\n“But now isn’t the time for that,” he said, cutting off those unneeded\nthoughts and rising from the sofa’s backrest.\n“Are you going, Brother?” asked Miyuki, watching the now-standing Tatsuya\nfrom the sofa with a pained look.\n“Be good and wait here for me.” Tatsuya’s palm stroked Miyuki’s cheek.\nShe put her own hand over his and pressed his palm to her cheek, almost as if\nmaking sure he was still alive. “I will await your return tonight.”\n“Yeah. Before long, I’ll definitely need your strength. When the time comes\n—”\n“Yes. When the time comes, we’ll do it together. That’s a promise, Brother.”\n“…Well, I don’t think it’ll be as dangerous as Yokohama was anyway,” he said\na little jokingly. Miyuki released his hand with a smile.\nTatsuya had more than just his favorite CAD. As he headed for the conflict\nwith various other pieces of equipment, his sister saw him off at the front door.",

She wasn’t wholly incompetent when it came to machines,\nbut if one were to categorize her as either skilled or unskilled, she would\ndefinitely fall into the latter category.\nBut she was gifted with a good memory. Not as good as Tatsuya’s, who could\nfreely control his memory functions as a side effect of his mind being altered,\nbut reproducing the procedure she’d watched him use presented her with no\ndifficulty.\nShe called up the screens she’d just been watching with her brother. The\nscroll speed for the text data was a little too fast for her, but she wasn’t skilled\nenough to change the settings, so she would put up with it.\nAs she watched the points of light move around, she desperately tried to\ndeduce her brother’s whereabouts.

It was an illegal carry, of course,\nbut he certainly wasn’t about to worry about that now. As the vampire evaded\na knife strike and made a big leap, he, in perfectly natural fashion, aimed\nroughly for her stomach and offhandedly pulled the trigger.\nHis handgun’s average effective firing range was fifty yards, with its effective\nrange in actual combat being twenty yards and closer.

And the restrictions Yakumo had imposed on himself\nwere both.\n“There are actually a couple little reasons.” His tone was as detached as it\nalways was, so Miyuki had a hard time seeing through to his thoughts. “I\nbecame a priest and renounced the world, but I didn’t renounce the shinobi\narts. This problem goes beyond me.”\nNot that he couldn’t renounce them—but that he hadn’t. Miyuki couldn’t\nsense any strain or despair in that; it was a completely regular part of Yakumo…\nAt least, that’s how it looked to her.\n“There are also the duties, the responsibilities of those who inherit those\nskills… This might also be an extremely worldly affair, but even the priesthood\ncan’t stay detached from authority and tradition. I think this is allowed, don’t\nyou?”\nMiyuki had no way to answer that. No matter who she was, it wasn’t\nsomething you asked a fifteen-year-old girl.\n“Mm…” she said.

Lab Nine’s mission statement is to develop\nmagicians with rationalized, resystematized old magic packaged as modern\nmagic. They gathered a lot of old-magic casters together for it.

Or had she simply appeared\ntaller until now?\nThis beauty was nothing a tiny little mask could conceal.\nI see, thought Tatsuya. If she could even make her body type different, it\nmade sense that she’d been able to blind eyes around the world. If not for the\npiles of data he’d accumulated, even he probably wouldn’t have known.\nWithout his realizing it, his hands and mind were moving.

The speed with which she did this\nwasn’t possibly hers naturally, but at the end of the day, it wasn’t extraordinary,\neither.\nTatsuya removed a lead ball from his pocket and flicked it.\nIt cut through the wind, soaring toward Lina’s right hand—and penetrated it.\nNo blood spattered.\nHe hadn’t shot through flesh.

The dagger launched from a point about a\nyard away from its location as seen by Tatsuya’s eyes.\nJumping to the side to dodge, his eyes followed its trajectory. Beyond where\nhe watched, the illusion readied a second throwing dagger.\nHis physical eyes perceived where the girl in the small mask was, and his\nmind’s eye knew it was an empty projection.\nWhat a pain! he cursed to himself. Knowing the theory and experiencing it for\nreal were different; he was out of his element.\nThe factors described by the information bodies making up the Parade spell\nwere color, shape, sound, heat, and position. Same as Yakumo’s illusion art,\nCocoon.\nWhereas Cocoon projected color, shape, sound, and heat that were exactly\nthe same as those of the real thing but in a different location, Lina’s Parade\nspell placed more emphasis on projecting a different color and a different\nshape. That didn’t mean it had cut out the part about camouflaging location,\nthough. This magic program, which Kudou had come up with and Lina had\ninherited, was equipped with the same position-blurring function.",
  "page_200": "Right now, Lina was diverting the calculation power from camouflaging her\ncolor and shape into camouflaging her position, trying not to let Tatsuya grasp\nher real body’s coordinates. And if he couldn’t identify those, he couldn’t use\nmagic on her. It would essentially disable magic that specified coordinates\nbased on visual data. The difference between Parade and illusion arts lay in how\nthe first could falsify one’s coordinates even in the information dimension.\nIn order to apply magic to something, you had to project a magic program\nonto the target object’s eidos. For example, in order to use a file on a computer,\nyou had to specify a path for the directory it was stored in, then use an execute\ncommand. But checking the path all the time was a pain, so shortcuts were\nwidely used. If you switched a shortcut with a fake one whose path linked to a\ndummy file with no contents, you would get an error when you tried to change\nthe file, even though you went through the same process.\nApplying this concept to the magical activation process, in most cases, one’s\nvisual information was the shortcut icon, and auditory and heat-sensing\ninformation would fit into that. Fooling the visual information with an illusion\nwould cause magic not to activate, but if the main body and illusion overlapped,\nyou could usually still arrive at the main body’s eidos using the coordinate\ninformation. In this case, despite the lag in his activation time, his spells were\nstill working fine.\nEven if you projected an illusion somewhere other than the main body, you\ncould also still search for the main body’s eidos using the relationship between\nthe illusion and body as a key. But with the coordinates camouflaged and a\ndummy of the main body prepared in the information dimension, any magic\nprogram he fired using his sensory information as a shortcut would end up not\ndoing anything.\nThat was the system behind the anti-magic spell Parade.\nWhich meant that in order to break it, he had to either: —destroy the illusion,\nand then find and attack the main body before a new illusion was formed…\n—or locate the main body’s coordinates without relying on his senses, instead\ngoing through the Idea, to attack.\nThe former option wasn’t going very well at the moment. Lina was already",

But it was a kind of gamble,\nshifting most of his awareness from the physical dimensions to the information\none while under physical attack.\n…No other choice.\nAs he dodged the fifth dagger, he made up his mind. He wouldn’t try to find\nthe main body and attack before a new illusion formed, nor would he directly\nsearch for her eidos in the Idea. There was a third option.\nHe took out of his pocket a cylindrical can small enough to fit in his hand.\nAnd then he tossed it up.\nFor a moment, Lina gave him a dubious expression. But when she realized\nwhat the “can” was, it opened her eyes.\nA small shrapnel grenade.\n“Je—”\nMaybe she wanted to say Jesus, but she couldn’t finish. Not wasting the time\nto finish even her short word, she expanded a physical barrier.\nConstant deceleration.\nMeanwhile, with flash casting, Tatsuya triggered an area-of-effect spell that\ndecelerated object movement speeds at a fixed rate. It was impossible for a\nweak barrier created by a virtual magic region to completely stop the shrapnel\ngrenade he’d thrown. A halting spell that brought speeds to zero might buckle\nunder the shrapnel’s kinetic energy, its event alteration failing.\nThat was why he used constant deceleration. Even so, decelerating an object\nto a small fraction of its original speed, like a hundredth or a thousandth, was\ntoo much for him.\nWeighing the specs of the weapon he’d prepared for himself against the\ninterfering power of his virtual magic region, he cast the spell at a level where it\nwould just barely work.",

It was a relaxed gesture, but it wasn’t hard\nto realize it was feigned.\n“I didn’t know where you were. Standard tactics say to smoke you out with a\nnondirectional attack, right?”\n“Most would call that an indiscriminate attack.”\n“Interpret it that way if you wish. Unfortunately, I have no skill with\nmanipulating area-of-effect magic. Anyway, I knew for certain you’d be able to\ndefend against it, so give me a break.”\n“You got hurt, though. Doesn’t seem worth it.”\n“I had to in order to capture you.”\n“You wanted to capture me? If you wanted to whisper sweet nothings into my\near, I would have preferred a more romantic approach.”\nTatsuya looked into the blue eyes behind the mask and smirked. After\nbringing her hands over her head, one on top of the other, he used one of his\nown to suppress her opened palm.\nWhen he brought his empty hand toward her mask, her shoulders gave a jerk.\nA finger on her thickly gloved left hand tried to move, but Tatsuya pushed it\nopen by force.\n“…Tatsuya, that hurts.”",

Her cover was long ago blown—did she\nstill not want to expose her face? He couldn’t understand the mentality, but it\nwasn’t like he was tearing off her clothes or anything, so he had no reason to\nstop.\n“Activate, Dancing Blaze!”\nAs his hand touched her mask, Lina shouted, her face still turned.\nThe five daggers she’d already thrown returned at her voice and attacked\nhim.\nA voice-activated armament device… It keeps a delayed-activation spell at the\nready, not an activation sequence? Interesting, he thought to himself, sensing\nthe daggers quickly converging on him.\nTwo went for his right arm, reaching for the mask, one for his right shoulder,\none for his left arm, and one for his legs.\nNone of them would hit a vital spot.\nCome to think of it, Lina’s attacks were all to disable me, not kill me… As he\nconsidered this, the daggers had already reached his body.\nAnd the instant they made contact, they all turned into fine sand and\nscattered.\n“Corrosion… No, dismantling…?” muttered Lina, overcome with surprise,\nturning her averted eyes back to him.\nIgnoring her, Tatsuya got back to peeling the mask off.\nShe shook her head fiercely to resist him, but she couldn’t shake off his hand.\n“You’ll regret this, Tatsuya!”\n“I’ve let the target I nearly captured escape. I already regret this plenty.”\nAs he and Lina were struggling about, the parasite had made a clean getaway.\nThough he had insurance for it, he couldn’t deny a feeling of vain effort. Lina\nwas chasing the vampire, too, which made Tatsuya wonder what she stood to",

He unlatched the receivers on her ears, left and then right.\nAs he’d thought, the mask doubled as an information terminal.\nHe gently removed the surprisingly hard mask. Even Tatsuya, who was used to\npretty girls, nearly breathed a sigh at her exposed beauty.\nLina bit her lip and glared sharply at him.\nA moment later, a scream that could tear silk exited her lips.\nIt was too sudden. Tatsuya’s eyes turned into dots.\nHe didn’t loosen his grip on her hands despite his shock, thanks to the\nextremely thorough training he’d received from Kazuma, a man of poor\ncharacter.\n“Somebody! Somebody help me!”\nIt was exactly the shout of a girl seeking rescue from a rapist.\nAnd the perpetrator—well, Tatsuya—stared at her realistic performance with\na dreary look.\nThen, as though others had been waiting for Lina’s scream signal, he heard\nfootsteps running toward them. Figures wearing navy-blue bulletproof vests\nwith white lines made of reflective material on them over equally navy-blue\nuniforms, one from each of the four compass directions, were approaching. The\ninsignia shining on the fronts of their caps was an informal crest of a cherry\nblossom.\nAs Tatsuya grabbed Lina’s left arm and dragged her up, he tore the glove off\nher left hand. With the sensation of cords splitting and cracking, Lina’s white\nhand became visible.\n“Raise your hands and turn around!” shouted the police officer—no, the man\ndressed as a police officer—who ran to them from the front, pointing a gun at\nhim.\nTatsuya went around behind Lina and shoved her toward the man.",

A hundred years ago, maybe, but current Japanese criminal\nlaw applies to foreign aggression crimes even if no martial force was used. If\nyou thought people disguised as the cops would intimidate me, you couldn’t be\nmore wrong. I’d like it if you stopped underestimating the resolve of Japanese\nmagicians.”\nThe three remaining fakes looked at the expression of Lina for instructions—\ntheir commander, Angie Sirius.\nAfter sighing, she turned to Tatsuya and gave a light, polite bow. “I apologize\nfor my rudeness. I did indeed underestimate you. Hearing and seeing are\nentirely different. As another magician, I am sorry.”\nThen, she put her feet together, straightened her spine, and brought her right\nhand up horizontally to her forehead. Even without a military cap, it was an\nunmistakable soldier salute.\nBefore, she had acted as a single magician—from now on, it would be as the\ncommander of the USNA Army’s magician forces.\nThat was how Tatsuya understood her display of intent.\n“I am Major Angelina Sirius, commander of the Stars magician unit, under the\ndirect command of the USNA Army’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

It is unfortunate—there were plenty of ways to play around the facts if I\nstill had my mask.”\n“So that’s what you meant by regretting this.” With the murderous intent\nblowing on him like a wind, Tatsuya let a fearless smile show.\n“If you had at least allowed yourself to be deceived and captured, we could\nhave finished without needing to kill you.”\n“Well, excuse me. I seem to have wasted the consideration you were kind\nenough to show me.”\n“No, you needn’t apologize. We need to kill you because of our own selfish\nreasons. You may feel free to resist.”\nOne of the fake police officers handed her a combat knife for her right hand\nand a midsize pistol for her left.\nA sword-shaped armament device and a handgun-shaped specialized CAD.\nTatsuya drew his own from inside his clothes.\n“This really is a shame, Tatsuya. I’d started to like you quite a bit, you know.”\nLina raised her left hand and pointed her CAD at Tatsuya.\nTatsuya raised his right hand and pointed his CAD at Lina.\nLina’s subordinates surrounded Tatsuya to the back and either side.\n“…Good-bye, Tatsuya.”\n“I won’t let you do that, Lina!”\nSuddenly, an imperious voice rattled the freezing midwinter air.\nShock appeared in Lina’s azure eyes as she turned to look toward where it\nhad come from.",

The constant admiration\nwas getting on his nerves, so he replied sarcastically. “I know you were hiding\nuntil your chance came.”",

And even though Yakumo’s gaze was on\nTatsuya, his still had Lina completely in his view.\nLina was now the one surrounded.\n“Well, what’s the fuss? It looks like you had some things to ask, too,” she said.\n“Huh? Is that true, Brother?”\nMiyuki turned around, expression dismayed. It meant taking her eyes off Lina,\nbut with Tatsuya and Yakumo ramping up the pressure on her, she couldn’t\nmake a move.\nMiyuki noticed her own failure right away, though, and hurriedly returned her\ngaze to Lina.\n“You had us surround her on purpose so that we could get information from\nher… I was utterly ignorant of your idea, and I made an assertive move. Forgive\nme, Brother.”\nWith her eyes on Lina, Miyuki asked Tatsuya’s forgiveness in a voice full of\nsorrow.\n“No, I was definitely in danger, so you made the right decision. You don’t have\nto apologize. In fact, I should be grateful. Thank you, Miyuki.”\n“Brother…I’m not worthy of such words…” his sister muttered, her expression\nintoxicated. Still, whenever Miyuki apologized to Tatsuya, this was the\npredictable development. Or maybe it was a kind of ritual, or beauty of form.\nConsidering her eyes still hadn’t left Lina, though, she seemed to have a bare\nminimum of reason left.\n“And we can just ask anything we want now anyway,” he said, both to Miyuki\nand to let Lina hear it. He pronounced every sound, every syllable distinctly,\nmaking Lina sure that he was talking to her, too.\n“…You plan to use force to interrogate me?” asked Lina, the sound of grating\nteeth accompanying her voice.\n“Aren’t interrogations usually done with force?” he replied—an indirect yes.",

That’s unfair!” she cried, a full-on frustrated\ncriticism.\n“Unfair?” cut in Miyuki, astonished. “How many people did you get just to\nsurround my brother?”\n“Now, don’t say that,” said Tatsuya, trying to soothe her before her\nastonishment changed to anger. “Fair is a superficial term, used to maintain\nyour advantage when you’re already in an advantageous position, and unfair is\na convenient word to bring an opponent to the negotiating table when you’re in\na disadvantageous one. Tactically speaking, trying to skirt around having to fight\nwhen you know your strength isn’t enough is correct. It’s all over if you take her\nseriously, Miyuki.”\n“I see. I understand how it is.”\nWhat Tatsuya had said was altogether too blunt, but it seemed to calm Miyuki\ndown, at least.\n“Superficial? Convenient?”\nAt the same time, though, it seemed to rile Lina up.\nIncidentally, Yakumo was busy trying to muffle laughter.\n“Japanese people are the last people I want to hear that from! You feel no\nshame taking advantage of insincere words!”\n“Aren’t you a quarter Japanese, too?”\n“…!”\n“The Parade you were using was developed in Japan, and you can use it\nbecause you have Kudou blood—the blood of a Japanese person, right?\nBesides, double standards are a specialty of the white establishment. I’ve never\nheard of people who don’t take advantage of insincerity.”\nLina glared at him without a word, her white skin flushing red. But since she\nwas both glaring and not speaking, it probably meant she didn’t know what to\nsay to that.\nAs he took her stare with a (mean) grin, he realized the bloodthirsty mood in\nthe air had thinned and let out a dry laugh.",

Just thinking that if we interrogated you like this, you’d get all stiff-\nnecked and wouldn’t tell us anything.”\n“You could at least call it stubborn!”\nShe really is fluent in Japanese if she knew what that metaphor meant,\nthought Tatsuya, impressed—even though it really didn’t matter.\n“The other groups will probably get here soon, too…”\n“Hey! Are you listening to me?”\nIt was best to ignore what didn’t matter.\n“Lina, let’s make a fair trade. If one against three is cheating, then why not\nhave a one-on-one contest? If you win, I’ll let you go for today. In exchange, if I\nwin, you’ll give me honest answers to my questions. How does that sound?”\nEven if Lina won, they knew her identity. If Tatsuya won, she’d have to tell\nhim everything. The match itself was one-on-one, but it was certainly not an\nequitable deal.\n“…Fine.”\n“Wait!”\nAfter Lina racked her brains over it, she accepted the conditions, and at the\nsame time, Miyuki interrupted with an objection.\nTatsuya’s and Lina’s eyes went to Miyuki.\n“Brother, would you approve of leaving the duel with Lina to me?”\n“Miyuki, why would you—”\n“Remember this, Lina. I will not forgive anyone who tries to hurt my brother. I\nconsider you a rival and a friend, but I can never forgive you for attempting to\ntake his life, even if it wasn’t sincere. I will personally teach you your sin.”\nMiyuki’s eyes glowed with a light that was 100 percent serious.

The future of human civilization?”\n“Not interested. I’m a recluse.”\n“But you’re a magician, too!”\nYakumo was suggesting something that Lina’s perspective on the world\nconsidered impossible—something that couldn’t be allowed to happen. That\nmade it all the more unbelievable.\n“I’m a shinobi. Not a magician,” replied Yakumo, voice gentle—a firm\nnegative.\n“…Ninjutsu users are a kind of magician, aren’t they?”\n“Just because you can use magic doesn’t mean you have to become a\nmagician.”\nShe knew the meaning of the words he used.\nShe understood them.\nBut none of what Yakumo was saying made sense to her.\n“It’s like how just because you’re a magician, you don’t automatically have\nthe duty to serve your country.”\nIt didn’t make sense, but for some reason, she couldn’t argue, either.\nTheir sedan parked on a dry riverbed in the middle of nowhere.\nLina wasn’t acquainted with the place, so she didn’t know where it was.\nConsidering how long they’d been driving, they would be in the next prefecture\nover, but she was surprised there was a place like this in the suburbs of the\nTokyo megalopolis.",

To be more precise (but still approximately), the pressure of a\ngaseous body in an enclosed space was proportional to the square of the gas\nparticles’ movement speed.

But in the hands of someone with as much magic power as Miyuki, it was\nan antipersonnel anti-magic spell with a contingency plan.\nLina, however, fought the current’s force of suction and dug in her heels.\nShe fired something with a movement spell—a button?\nA bit of resin only given an initial velocity would never penetrate Miyuki’s\nDeceleration Zone, but by her shooting down such a slipshod projectile weapon,\nLina doubtless knew what kind of spell she was using now.\nIn that case!\nTatsuya told her almost daily that the attacker always needed to think two or\nthree steps ahead.

When the lift from the high-speed current\nthreatened to pick both her shield and her up off the ground, she managed to\nendure with a multiactivation of an inertial increasing spell. As she lay on her\nbelly, she peeled her eyes for a chance—no, an opening—to counterattack.\nShe wasn’t about to casually (?) wait for an opportunity.\nUntil now, all the initiative had been in Miyuki’s hands.\nShe was just a high school student, and Lina was commander of the world’s\nstrongest force.\nShe felt pride at that fact, of course, but above that, she felt a mental\npressure—things were only getting worse.\nIn any case, unless she could get in even a small counterattack, she’d be\novercome.\nExcluding very tough defensive magic, even magical combat favored the\nattacker over the defender. That was the theory.\nLina felt the wind pressure weakening. The blast of wind had come from the\ncancellation of magic, so it made sense that the wind would stop once all the\npressurized air was released.\nLina’s right hand gripped her combat knife.\nThey’d taken her handgun but not this knife, which was for activating Atomic\nDivider.\nThe previous Sirius had developed this magical armament device, now a\ntrump card for the Stars.",
  "page_225": "The spell extended a virtual region, and it needed enough influence to\novercome the enemy magician’s.\nAnd it couldn’t be just barely more—it had to be an entire rank higher.\nBut at the very least…\nI should be able to distract her with it!\nStill on the ground, she scattered daggers around so that Miyuki couldn’t see.\nShe canceled her inertial amplification, then got up as fast as she could.\nAtomic Divider.\nUp on one knee, she swung her right hand’s knife across.\nThe virtual region extended almost at the same time. She felt a strong force of\ninfluence unleashed between them that was unlike anything she’d ever\nexperienced.\nWhile the virtual region was still forming, the all-encompassing influence\nstamped it out.\nShe knew Miyuki would block it. Just as calculated, you might say.\n“Dancing Blaze!”\nBefore seeing her Atomic Divider get nullified, she fired her next spell.\nThe daggers she’d secretly spread about floated up and flew off at a blinding\nspeed.\nTraveling in an arc a hairbreadth away from the ground, they evaded the\nspace Miyuki controlled.\nFour blades attacking you from the sides and behind in the darkness. Block\nthat if you can!\nFeeling magic-tinged objects racing her way, Miyuki canceled her currently\nactivated attack spell and switched to perimeter defense magic.\nDaggers, flying around the space to attack her, lost their flight energy and fell\nto the ground.\nSignificantly more difficult than perceiving each individual object to defend,",
  "page_226": "and even more difficult than barrier magic that specified a direction—\nomnidirectional, indiscriminate defensive magic. But right now, Miyuki could\nuse it without a problem.\nShe could stop even attacks saturated with Lina’s—Sirius’s—magic power.\nIf she were in her usual state, with some of her control diverted to Tatsuya’s\nseal, she would have a hard time defending against this attack.\nShe might not have even been able to control such an elaborate spell in the\nfirst place.\nIf she’d challenged Lina to a duel alone, she would have lost… Miyuki mentally\noffered a prayer of thanks.\nIt’s because you’re watching, Brother… I won’t lose. I cannot lose!\nSeeing her technical, complicated surprise attack beaten by sheer force made\nboth a fear and a fighting spirit bubble up in Lina’s heart at once.\nAnd that heartburn-inducingly sweet scene from before suddenly flashed\nthrough her mind.\nShe could only see it as them making light of this battle.\nBut at the time, Tatsuya had whispered something to her.\nCome to think of it, he’d already broken her Dancing Blaze spell. He’d\nsimultaneously dismantled all five daggers simultaneously striking at him.\nIt wasn’t any molecular force neutralization spell she knew about, but the\nresult was that he, by some method, had broken their molecular bonds.\nBut that wasn’t the crucial issue.\nIt was that he’d dealt with several flying objects coming from different\ndirections all at once.\nShe thought to herself that it wasn’t only Miyuki’s power that blocked her\nattack.\nYes… He wouldn’t interfere, but he would have a word. Suits me fine!\nMiyuki thought:",
  "page_227": "I absolutely cannot lose.\nLina thought:\nI’ll crush her with everything I have.\nAnd both of them called out at once.\n“Miyuki!” “Lina!”\n“This is it!”\nSpace froze.\nSpace boiled.\nTheir magic power painted over the world, and the two worlds clashed.\nA world of ice and snow, glittering like a crystal.\nA world of fire and lightning, sparkling with electricity.\nThe air-freezing arctic hell, Niflheim.\nThe air-burning incandescent hell, Muspelheim.\nOne area-of-effect spell decelerated the vibration of gas particles, not only\nfreezing water vapor and carbon dioxide, but also liquefying nitrogen.\nOne area-of-effect spell dismantled the gas particles into plasma, then further\nseparated positive ions and electrons to create a high-energy electromagnetic\nfield.\nThe cold reverted the heated plasma to gas, and the heated plasma returned\nthe frozen air to normal.\nThe two clashing forces shed a curtain of aurora on the ground.\nA flickering, overlapping dance of polar lights.\nIt was truly a wondrous spectacle.\nEnough to make one forget that death waited just on the other side.\nTatsuya, his finger riding his CAD’s trigger, observed the scene carefully. If one\nof them lost control of her spell, he would immediately erase the spell itself.\nHe expected that disabling their two spells at once would be tough, but he",

He was\ndetermined to see this recklessness through to the end.\nAmid the dancing aurora, the clash of ice and snow with fire and lightning\nseemed like it would last forever. But before even a minute had passed, the\ntrend became clear.\nThe cold expanded, and the plasma diminished.\nMiyuki was, originally, a magician specializing in magic that brought about\nlarge-scale event alterations over a wide area.\nOn the other hand, Lina was a magician who focused her power on individual\nobjects and phenomena, causing acute event alterations.\nThis clash had begun with Miyuki in the advantageous position.\nAdding to that, this was Lina’s third battle in a row, after the vampire and\nTatsuya.\nShe may not have been aware of her symptoms, but the exhaustion had\naccumulated.\nAnd now this duel format had put her opponent at an advantage over her.\nMiyuki and Lina’s match wouldn’t be decided by a difference in magic power,\nbut by who could retain her calm rationality for longer.\n“Ugh…!”\nLina must have known that herself; a frustrated grunt escaped her lips.\nAnd she reached behind her, pulling out her armament device again. But a\nmulticast in this situation was, no matter how talented a magician she was,\ntantamount to suicide.\n“That’s enough, both of you!” shouted Tatsuya, pulling his CAD’s trigger.\nHis Program Dispersion wiped out both Miyuki’s Niflheim and Lina’s\nMuspelheim at the same time.\nThe cold air mixing drastically with the flames and lightning, a wind that\nwould cause burns and frostbite at once blew around violently.

What have you done?!”\nHer face pale, Miyuki ran over to him.\nLina watched him, dumbstruck.\nProtecting themselves from the mere aftereffects, the heat and cold waves,\nwould have been a piece of cake no matter how tired they were. But it wasn’t\nsomething Tatsuya could manage. He knew his own talents well. At times like\nthese, he envied the ability to use normal magic.\n“Dear me… Tatsuya, what will we do about this?”\nAnd he didn’t know how the man had protected himself, but in any case, the\nunharmed Yakumo spoke to him with affected shock in his voice— Well, the\ndisciples he’d brought who were behind him were covered in dirt and mud.\nThey must have dived into the earth to escape. The doton art, most likely.\n“Master…what do you mean?”\nTatsuya knew now how he’d escaped the chill and the high heat, but he didn’t\nunderstand the question, so he asked honestly, or rather out of reflex.\nThis time, Yakumo gave him an astonished look that seemed more sincere.\n“Well, I mean…didn’t you decide that whoever surrendered or was\nincapacitated first would lose? You were the one who suggested this duel in the\nfirst place. Why did you go and break it up like that?”\nHe literally had no words.\nIf he hadn’t done what he had, it would have broken the “no killing” rule, so\nhe didn’t regret the act of intervening itself.\nBut this match was just an excuse to settle the situation to begin with.\nIn actuality, the question of how to deal with Lina was extremely\ntroublesome.\nAs an official soldier, her rights as a captive were guaranteed. He wouldn’t\nhave needed to care had her identity still been under wraps, but Lina had\nalready told him she was the Stars commander and a major in the USNA Army.",
  "page_230": "And he’d known that previously anyway, so he couldn’t ignore her rights as a\ncaptive.\nEven if she didn’t have any during a legal engagement, if she was conducting\nactual military affairs, she had rights as a prisoner.\nAnd before that, Tatsuya and the others were civilians. They couldn’t take\nLina, a soldier, prisoner.\nHe could if he displayed his connection with the Independent Magic Battalion,\nbut unfortunately, he couldn’t reveal something that confidential.\nIf they interrogated or confined her without proper authority, it would only\ngive the USNA a political excuse. And execution was out of the question.\nOf course, Lina’s side would face criticism for attacking civilians as well, but\nunfortunately, the rights guaranteed to a magician as a civilian were severely\nlimited. In terms of justice in public international law, Tatsuya and the others\nhad grim prospects.\nBut that didn’t mean they could set her free without doing anything,\nespecially considering the future. How would he resolve the situation…?\nTatsuya felt as though it was giving him a headache.\n“We’ll say it’s my loss.”\nBut he didn’t have to worry for long. Rescue found him from an unexpected\nplace.\n“At that rate, I would have been defeated. If I’d diverted my capacity to other\nmagic, Miyuki’s spell would have swallowed me whole and I might have lost my\nlife. I would have needed a few months in the hospital at the very least.”\nLina looked at Tatsuya and Miyuki and admitted her own defeat in a\nsportsmanlike manner.\n“Miyuki, I lost. Tatsuya, I don’t intend to bother you with disgraceful\nstruggling.”\nBut it was too soon to breathe a sigh of relief at the situation resolving itself.\n“I promise I’ll answer anything you ask me. However…”",
  "page_231": "“However what?”\n“But my answers will be yes or no. If I can’t answer a question like that, then I\nwon’t. You changed the conditions Miyuki and I agreed on by spoiling our\nmatch, so I hope you don’t mind me changing a small condition as well,\nTatsuya.”\nLina had been beaten more soundly than he’d expected.\nShe gave a wonderful smile that you wouldn’t think a loser would give, and\nTatsuya had no choice but to agree to the new terms.\n(To be continued)",
  "page_232": "AFTERWORD\nThank you for purchasing another volume of The Irregular at Magic High\nSchool. For those new, allow me to take the opportunity to say that it’s a\npleasure to meet you, and I look forward to your continued support.\nThe book’s subtitle is Visitor Arc, Part I. All sorts of visitors keep pulling the\nprotagonists into the middle of the incident. Big-shot guest characters appear\nas well. There are victims on the protagonist side, too. The incident evolves into\na complex three-sided fight, plus a little more. It is just a tad romantic (and I will\naccept any objections to that). As you can see, this story of the magic high\nschool students is a bit different from the first eight volumes, but I think you’ll\nenjoy it.\nNow, there is something I need to excuse myself to everyone for. I’m sorry,\nbut this arc will be a three-parter. Maybe it’s the recoil from the Reminiscence\nArc being one volume. We couldn’t fit the whole Visitor Arc into two parts.\nActually, Dengeki Bunko has no word limit (unless it gets way out of hand), so\nwe could have if we’d wanted to…but circumstances dictated we take this\napproach. It will mean a slightly longer wait for this episode’s climax, but my\nopinion is that I’ll create something everyone can enjoy all the more for it.\nThe schedule was tighter than usual for this one. I predict that parts two and\nthree will end up creating a busy schedule, too. To everyone involved, allow me\nto apologize again. And thank you very much. I hope for your support for the\nnext book, too, so that we can deliver the continuation to those who are fond\nof this story not a day later than we need to.\nIn closing, I’d like to give another thanks to all the readers who purchased this\nbook. I pray that we’ll see each other again in the next volume, Visitor Arc, Part\nII.\nTsutomu Sato",
