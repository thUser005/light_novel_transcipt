You are given text from a novel page. Convert it into a transcript.

Rules:
1. Output ONLY a JSON array of objects.
2. Each object must have exactly one key:
   - "Narrator" for descriptive sentences.
   - Character name for dialogue lines.
3. Do NOT include page numbers, metadata, or any other extra keys.
4. Preserve the order of sentences exactly as in the text.
5. Do NOT invent new content or modify the sentences. Only restructure them into objects.

Example:

Input text:
The wind howled through the trees as John approached the old house. 
"Are you sure we should be doing this?" Mary whispered, clutching his arm. 
He looked back at her, eyes determined. "We have no choice." 
A crow cawed somewhere above, and the door creaked open on its own.

Output JSON:
[
  {"Narrator": "The wind howled through the trees as John approached the old house."},
  {"Mary": "Are you sure we should be doing this?"},
  {"John": "We have no choice."},
  {"Narrator": "A crow cawed somewhere above, and the door creaked open on its own."}
]
