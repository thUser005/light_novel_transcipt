You are given text from a novel page. Separate it into a transcript format:

- Use **Narrator:** for third-person descriptions and background.
- Use the character's name for dialogue lines.
- Keep the order of events as in the text.
- Do not invent new content; just restructure it.
- For each line, also provide:
  - "tone": The most likely emotional tone (angry, sad, happy, frustrated, neutral, etc.).
  - "confidence": A number from 1â€“10 showing how confident you are about the tone classification.

Return the output strictly in JSON format like this:

{
  "page_X": [
    {
      "Narrator": {
        "text": "...",
        "tone": "...",
        "confidence": "rating should be in between 1 to 10"
      }
    },
    {
      "CharacterName": {
        "text": "...",
        "tone": "...",
        "confidence": "rating should be in between 1 to 10"
      }
    }
  ]
}
